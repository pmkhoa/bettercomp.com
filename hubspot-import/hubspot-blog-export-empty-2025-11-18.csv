But when the role is entirely new to your organization, the preparation for hiring is different. The situation becomes even more complex when the job is new to the entire market or is extremely niche and unique.</p>
<p>The job and skills markets are always evolving &nbsp;— positions like AI or machine learning engineers are extremely specialized, but AI and data science are among the <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.nu.edu/blog/ai-job-statistics/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">fastest-growing job categories in 2025</a></span>. An important question is emerging alongside these new skillsets: How should they be paid? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Your traditional market pricing strategy may feel like it’s impossible when you’re tasked with pricing a niche position because it can be extremely challenging to find reliable data or make your usual moves fit this specific market. While your usual pricing strategy might not be a perfect fit, there are certainly tweaks you can make to help mold your typical tactics to a unique, newly emerging role.</p>
<p>One important thing to keep in mind when adjusting your pricing strategy is that your usual strategy is never static anyway! Even for the most straightforward market pricing exercise, you need to go through the following motions to ensure you’re getting a clear picture of what the market is telling you:</p>

When working with rapidly emerging or changing roles, consider what type of data sources you’re working with and when they publish. If you want data that’s a closer match to the current market conditions, you can leverage surveys with year-round publishing cycles, such as <span style=\""color: #3473f2;\""><a href=\""https://www.culpepper.com/\"" rel=\""noopener\"" target=\""_blank\"" style=\""color: #3473f2;\"">Culpepper</a></span>, or quarterly cycles, like Aon’s <span style=\""color: #3473f2;\""><a href=\""https://www.aon.com/en/capabilities/human-capital-analytics/radford-mclagan-compensation-database\"" rel=\""noopener\"" target=\""_blank\"" style=\""color: #3473f2;\"">Radford McLagan Compensation Database</a></span>. Finding data sources with more frequent survey cycles and timely updates provides your organization with up-to-date compensation benchmarks to support confident pay decisions.

While you can adjust your typical market pricing strategy to fit unique roles, sometimes you need a unique pricing strategy. Whether you’re building an individualized strategy or merging your existing strategy with some new parameters, there are three steps I recommend when pricing a specialized role:<br><!--more-->
<h3>1. Assess Internal Value and Impact</h3>
<p>Jobs are worth one thing in the market, but they’re worth something entirely different to your team’s goals. To determine a role’s worth to your team, look inward to consider its desired impact. If you can calculate the direct revenue generation potential or cost savings this role is expected to deliver, then you can quickly justify an investment in the role. For instance, if your new AI engineer builds a feature that saves $5M, they are worth more than a role that is expected to impact $4M in business.</p>
<p>Even if you can’t predict a revenue-related outcome, you can map the role's required experience, managerial scope, and decision-making authority to an existing, well-benchmarked level. You might find that this role operates at the same impact level as an existing Senior Director in the same department, therefore, it should be anchored near that pay band.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>2. Try Proxy Benchmarking</h3>
<p>In a similar exercise to how you compared the role to your existing internal structure, you should identify external, proxy “job neighbors.” Take time to find established job titles that share 70%+ of the required skills, such as comparing an AI Engineer against a Senior Data Scientist and a Software Architect. Creating an estimated pay range that’s grounded in adjacent roles helps you find a benchmark where you can feel like one doesn’t currently exist.<br>If there aren’t great “neighbors” for your role, you can try taking the role apart to look at its pieces. Instead of looking at the whole of the position, you can ""unravel"" the role's requirements into separate skills and assign a monetary value to each component based on existing roles. Think <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><em>Skill A + Skill B + Skill C = An Ideal Range for the Overall Role</em></span>, and then add a 10-20% Novelty Uplift to the total sum to account for the risk and experimental nature of the new role.</p>
<h3>3. Consider Sources with Immediate Feedback</h3>
<p>Compensation professionals love their data, and sometimes the best data comes from unexpected places! You can supplement data from your traditional salary surveys with a real-time data source (like <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.compa.ai/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">Compa’s offer data</a></span>), information from similar job postings, or anecdotal data that you can gather through internal conversations.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">“Competition for emerging skill sets can be fierce; understanding what companies are offering can be critical to creating a winning strategy to close and then keep in-demand talent.” —Ashley Case, Director of Insights at Compa.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your talent acquisition team and hiring managers are on the front lines with candidates, so they’re a great (often untapped) resource for compensation data. Talking with recruiters throughout the hiring process can be a great way to find candidate feedback and allows you to quickly course-correct before candidates move further into the interview process. Candidates' salary expectations can serve as a mini-market survey, so you can look for patterns in where expectations cluster.</p>
<p>Remember: emerging roles are subject to rapid salary deflation as the market catches up and talent scales. Don't set a compensation strategy in stone - remain confident, but flexible in your choices. To remain nimble and up to date, commit to reviewing the compensation of emerging roles every 3-6 months, not the standard 12, until the market matures and stabilizes. It’s also important to remember that your pay practices are meant to serve your organization’s people and goals, not just match the market “perfectly.” Define the “perfect” offer strategy for your team’s unique roles and <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/pay-practices-that-make-an-impact"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">consider how your total rewards packages create the impact you're aiming to create</a></span>. Paying correctly for unique jobs is more than the money or benefits, instead it’s about signaling your commitment to innovation. Embrace the complexity now to win the talent later!</p>

Unfortunately, creating a new role or filling a vacancy takes time. Slow, ineffective hiring processes cause delays or worst case, a bad placement. A clear, disciplined approach to hiring (supported by the right data, tools, and processes) ensures you get it right, every time.<br><br>When openings pop up, they might be a surprise — and if your team isn’t ready to post the position and hit the ground running, you run the risk of missing that “right time” requirement for right talent, right skills, right time.<br><br>If your job data isn’t easily accessible or is out of date, you’re setting your team up for a clunky, possibly drawn-out hiring process. For example, maybe the drafted job description is from three years ago, so it doesn’t attract the right candidates. The hiring manager may not be clear on their budget for a specific role or be unsure if the proposed budget is truly aligned with the candidate’s skill set. Of course, with any prolonged opening, the hiring manager is extra busy because they have to do their own work plus the work not being accomplished because of the vacancy. Moving quickly to get a job posted means you’ll find the right talent faster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The secret to <em>always</em> being ready to start hiring? Keep your job data fresh and your internal processes smooth.</p>

<h3>5 Steps for (Quickly) Preparing a New Job Posting</h3>
<h4>&nbsp;</h4>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">1. Start with an Initial Intake.</span></h4>
<p>Whether you are an HR business partner, recruiter, or compensation analyst, it is important to connect with hiring managers and get questions answered.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the position budgeted?</li>
<li>How critical is the role?</li>
<li>Are you looking at internal candidates? If not, what are the skill gaps or other factors?</li>
<li>Have you drafted a job description?<br><br></li>
</ul>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">2. Evaluate Team Readiness.</h4>
<p>Develop an internal process where recruiters, aligned HR partners, and perhaps others in HR operations (like a compensation analyst) have successful handoffs of their action items in preparing a job opening for recruiting. &nbsp;</p>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">3. Develop Fresh Job Content.</h4>
<p>Remember that your job postings’ listed skills, requirements, and compensation range are all representations of your <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/compensation-can-make-or-break-employer-brand"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">employer brand</a></span>. If the job posting or description on file is ~five years old, it probably needs a refresh before you cast the net within and outside your organization. The job market moves quickly, so before sharing anything with potential applicants, it’s essential to evaluate the <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://jdxpert.com/about/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">job data</a></span> and refresh as needed. Utilizing a resource like <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://jdxpert.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">JDXpert</a></span> helps you speed up the process of creating an accurate, active posting because it allows you to build one full-picture, governed job library. If job data is strewn across multiple systems, it takes precious time to gather <span style=""font-style: italic;"">and</span> update it all every time you need to post a new opening.</p>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">4. Benchmark the Role with Internal and External Data Sources.</h4>
<p>Ensure the role’s pricing is aligned with your compensation philosophy, as well as the market. Current employees performing at a successful level in the same or similar role offer a good internal benchmark for where you may find new talent and at roughly what cost. External benchmark comparisons ensure you meet marketplace expectations and hit the competitive mark when making an offer. Market pricing tools like <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/market-pricing"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">BetterComp</a></span> centralize survey data, model pay ranges by family and location, and flag gaps instantly. To really speed up your job-posting prep, use <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://jdxpert.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">JDXpert</a></span> and <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/partners"" rel=""noopener"" style=""color: #3473f2;"" target=""_blank"">BetterComp</a></span> in tandem to keep your job data and compensation information updated, accurate, and at the ready. BetterComp’s partnership with JDXPert fuses structured job data and market pricing intelligence into a single system of entry that snaps into any HRIS, without skipping a beat.&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">5. Collaborate with Efficient Project Management.</h4>
<p>Provide simple, intuitive, easy-access tools that connect decision makers throughout. Hold brief weekly sessions to connect on open requisitions, candidate slates, job content, and grading to identify and remove any blockages in the talent pipeline.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, while creating this process may be bumpy at first, if you stick with it, the ecosystem will thrive. Hiring effectively means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finance will have stronger headcount forecasts</li>
<li>Hiring managers won’t lose productive work time</li>
<li>Job applicants will provide more favorable feedback on social platforms</li>
<li>HR Operations can do more with less</li>
</ul>
<p>Recruiting, onboarding, and retaining employees can feel like a rollercoaster, but you can keep the ride exciting and fun if your team is prepared. Relying on fresh data and maintaining clear, streamlined workflows helps avoid delays and inconsistencies. By aligning on timelines, utilizing automated systems where possible, and keeping documentation organized, you can minimize confusion and reduce time-to-post — which helps you add the right talent to your team at the right time.</p>

We had a great conversation about how HR and compensation leaders can truly measure the impact of their compensation programs on employee engagement and retention.</p>
<p>For too long, compensation has been treated like a necessary cost center. Glizcel and I agree: it's time to reposition it as a strategic lever. To accomplish that transition, you need to notice the right signals and make the right adjustments to your program. Keep reading for a recap of key takeaways from our conversation, with insights on how you can evaluate your program and create pay practices that make a meaningful impact for your employees.</p>
<!--more-->
<h3>Metrics to Evaluate for a Successful Program</h3>
<p>The first step in creating impact is knowing what to measure. You can’t fix what you don’t track. Start by getting your team synced up on essential metrics you should be monitoring, including financial metrics, engagement (eNPS), voluntary turnover, and your overall retention rate, especially first-year and high-performer turnover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you evaluate these metrics, what really signals your program might need adjustment comes from digging deeper to find the <em>why</em>. You need to move beyond general turnover numbers to the specifics:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Evaluate voluntary turnover:</strong> You must mine your exit survey data to find out when compensation is the primary driver of a departure.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Review offer acceptance rates, specifically turn downs</strong> This is your leading indicator for market competitiveness. If your offer turndowns mention pay, your strategy is immediately out of sync with the talent market.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Standardize and track specific compensation survey questions:</strong> Find about five high-impact questions on your annual engagement survey that focus on compensation and total rewards. Then, pull those five questions into your pulse surveys as you prep for your open enrollment (OE) and wage review seasons. Comparing year-over-year (YOY) ratings on these specific questions gives you an instant, timely health check on employee sentiment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, these key metrics (whether compensation-forward like comparatio analysis or employee engagement-focused like the ""pay-coded"" turnover) are your signals for a healthy compensation program.</p>
<h3>Creating Impactful Compensation Practices</h3>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Measuring your program is one thing, but designing a program that thrives during a changing market is another. The challenge lies in finding a strategy that is steady enough to be fiscally responsible and nimble enough to keep up with changing employee and market expectations.</p>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Remaining Competitive in a Rapidly-Changing Climate</h4>
<p>After you’ve surfaced the “why” behind the effects of your compensation program, it’s time to turn your vision toward the future. The problem? You can’t predict the future.</p>
<p>The talent market can be rocked by unexpected elements, both external (like economic changes) and internal changes (like expansion to new areas). Having a strong foundation for compensation and employee engagement is a necessity for riding those changes out while remaining competitive. Rapidly changing economies also bring rapidly changing markets, so your compensation strategy cannot be static. It needs a built-in mechanism to flex with the ever-changing talent pool to capture niche and competitive skillsets when they become critical to the business.</p>
<p>To create programs that thrive through conditions you can’t plan for, you need to create protocols for quick evaluations and checks when something shifts unexpectedly. You might need to dig into your internal data again, adjust how your programs function, or change your budget, and you’ll need to be able to act fast.</p>
<p>At times, a smaller or tighter budget becomes a reality. My advice is to leverage non-monetary elements that are high-value: things like stretch assignments for career growth, flexible work arrangements, equity grants, and dedicated L&amp;D time can be powerful supplements to base pay. Think creatively about what's in the full picture of your Total Rewards strategy, even if you aren’t able to make typical salary adjustments.</p>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">Leveraging Variable Pay and Recruiting Tactics</h4>
<p>When it comes to recruitment, a strong program balances external competitiveness and internal equity, and you have to communicate both clearly. My take is that a rising tide must lift all boats. Yes, watching newer folks come in at higher compensation can be frustrating and contribute to wage compression, but a good compensation program will respond with regular internal equity reviews and increases for all. Bringing on great people leads to company success, and that success is the most powerful leverage you have to build better programs and raise the bar for everyone.</p>
<h3>Evaluation Strategies and Best Practices</h3>
<p>51% of our webinar attendees stated they review their compensation strategy and its impact on employee engagement annually. A core mistake companies make is treating pay as the primary driver of engagement or evaluating compensation and employee engagement in a vacuum. At the end of the day, a culture of communication, transparency, and support is what fosters growth and satisfaction for your employees.</p>
<p>When you decide to take a close look at the intersection of your compensation program with employee engagement, I recommend 4 clear steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define clear metrics for financial, talent acquisition, and employee-related impacts.</li>
<li>Gather a team of stakeholders across HR, Finance, and leadership to ensure alignment.</li>
<li>Create a schedule for regular audits and benchmarking against the market.</li>
<li>Prioritize communication and transparency in how pay is defined, delivered, and explained to both current and prospective employees.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ultimately, creating pay practices that make an impact is less about reacting to the market and more about proactive measurement, agile design, and a commitment to transparency. Remember, while pay is critical, it is always supported by a strong foundation of communication and culture. By defining clear metrics, involving stakeholders, scheduling regular audits, and prioritizing transparency, you can successfully reposition your compensation program as a powerful lever for long-term employee engagement and business success.</p>

They’ve made an impact in their department and have been rewarded with promotions along the way. They’re really shaping up to be a leader in the field, and they’ve become an integral part of the team.</p>
<!--more--><p>One day, they are chatting with the team and learn a new hire doing the exact same job is making the same (or more) money to do it. Do you think that leaves them feeling appreciated, supported, and energized to keep working hard? Probably not.</p>
<p>Pay compression most commonly occurs when long-term employees are paid close to or the same as recent hires and is a major driver of low morale, high turnover (especially of high-value veterans), and internal resentment. When designing a compensation philosophy, nobody aims to create a negative environment. However, when internal equity isn’t maintained and pay compression creeps in, employees can become disillusioned and decide to find a new position that they feel values their skillset appropriately. Employee turnover is costly for time, effort, and money — think of the knowledge gaps created if your high-performing, loyal employee moves on.</p>
<p>To maintain equity and avoid pay compression, there are foundational elements and routine practices to implement into your compensation strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What Causes Pay Compression?<span style=""font-family: 'georgia, palatino', Arial, Arial; letter-spacing: -0.5px; background-color: transparent; color: #474554;""></span></h3>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">When creating equitable pay practices, you have to understand how pay compression happens and be able to spot it quickly. Pay compression doesn’t become an issue with one mis-priced job, it usually spreads across your program slowly and is created by multiple compounding internal and external factors. The following factors, if they go unchecked, often contribute to&nbsp;pay compression:</p>
<ol>
<li style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>Market shifts:</strong> Rapidly increasing starting salaries in tight labor markets can lead to an imbalance between salaries of new and existing employees.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>Minimum wage changes:</strong> Mandated increases at the bottom of the pay scale can “crunch” up the space between different levels of employee salaries.</li>
<li style=""font-weight: normal;""><strong>Inconsistent adjustments: </strong>A lack of regular, merit, or market-based pay reviews for existing employees can create salaries that are out-paced by the market.</li>
</ol>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">As your team grows, new positions can be added to headcount plans quickly, and that kind of hiring hustle can cause teams to focus on what’s needed to entice the right new hire rather than evaluate how this new hire fits into an existing wage structure. While strategically pricing salaries for new hires is a huge part of maintaining equity, you also have to evaluate how you’re paying your current employees. Budget constraints can lead to minimal annual raises for incumbents, while market-driven salaries for new hires surge past them. You can’t control the market, and rapid wage inflation or high competition for talent forces higher starting salaries for new employees, but you can control how you work to help your current employee salaries keep up with the ebbs and flows of the market.<br><span style=""font-family: 'georgia, palatino', Arial, Arial; letter-spacing: -0.5px; background-color: transparent;""></span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-family: 'georgia, palatino', Arial, Arial; letter-spacing: -0.5px; background-color: transparent;"">4 Steps for Maintaining Equity and Preventing Pay Compression</span></h3>
<h4 style=""font-weight: normal;"">&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">1. Establish and Audit Market-Driven Salary Bands</h4>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you’re cleaning up equity issues, the place to start is often the most messy: salary bands. Pay compression often stems from salary bands that haven’t been updated to match the market or from salaries being set outside of the set ranges. Start by digging into what’s happening in the market, then define clear minimum, midpoint, and maximum ranges (bands) for every role based on reliable external market data.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Once you set salary bands, take time to evaluate any existing equity issues and make any necessary adjustments to rectify them. These salary bands need to be audited <em><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">at least</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span></em>annually to ensure they reflect current market rates and maintain internal equity. During these maintenance audits, it’s also important to confirm that the maximum of the entry-level band does not significantly overlap with the minimum of the next-highest band so you offer clear differentials for employee promotions and growth.</p>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">2. Implement Structured Growth Plans</h4>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Once you narrow your salary bands, the next step is to implement a structured growth and merit plan. If you want to support your employees’ loyalty and contributions, it’s time to move beyond fixed-percentage annual raises. Linking pay increases directly to a combination of performance ratings, tenure/experience, and position within the salary band creates a more equitable approach and helps you avoid existing employees feeling a “crunch” when new hires enter the team with a competitive salary.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">These merit plans are also not purely financial paths. While employee turnover can be attributed to financial reasons, <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/shephyken/2023/07/09/beyond-money-the-real-reasons-employees-stay-or-leave/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">a leading reason for regrettable turnover is a lack of growth opportunities</a></span>. A <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/webinar-recap-job-architecture-and-survey-data"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">strong job architecture</a></span> is a necessity for defining career ladders and can also clear up confusion about how salary bands are applied to employees with different levels of experience. Outlining levels for each department &nbsp;(like what differentiates a ""Software Engineer I"" from a ""Software Engineer II"") guarantees that moving up the ladder offers a significant pay bump and a change in responsibilities, reinforcing the value of tenure and skill growth.</p>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">3. Regularly, Holistically Evaluate Equity</h4>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">If you’re putting the work into creating an equitable compensation program, you don’t want to watch that work go to waste due to a lack of maintenance. Conduct a formal, internal equity review (separate from the performance review cycle) every 18-24 months to catch any compression issues that have popped up. This is a great opportunity to identify long-term employees whose current pay falls below the midpoint of their tenure/skill level, especially relative to recent hires. It can help to dedicate a specific, ongoing budget line item (separate from the standard merit budget) for ""Compression &amp; Equity Adjustments,” so you can apply targeted, lump-sum adjustments to restore the internal pay differentials and recognize employees’ accumulated value.</p>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">4. Foster Transparency and Educate Managers</h4>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">A commitment to equity and employee retention shouldn’t be a secret mission, and in many areas, <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/3-pillars-of-a-pay-transparency-ready-comp-program"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">pay transparency is now required by law</a></span>. Transparency builds trust and reduces the speculation that often drives complaints about perceived pay inequities. Train managers to clearly communicate the company’s compensation philosophy — not specific salaries, but how pay decisions are made. Giving managers the tools and visibility (within policy constraints) to explain why an employee's pay falls where it does can also help ease conversations about where they’re headed in their career journey and what steps they need to take (skill acquisition, performance) to advance.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Pay compression is not an isolated event, instead it’s the result of falling behind on equity maintenance. Addressing equity requires commitment and should be viewed as a pillar of a strong compensation program. Ultimately, taking an equity-focused lens when evaluating your program leads to a foundational investment in your employees, transforming what could be a silent killer of morale into an engine that drives high performance, retention, and trust across your entire organization.<br><br></p>

<p>As pay transparency legislation continues to evolve, legal compliance is obviously a top priority, but forward-thinking organizations should aim to move beyond simply adhering to these laws. Instead, the increased attention on pay transparency creates an opportunity to build employee trust and attract top talent.</p>
<p>To create a compensation program that you can share confidently and proudly, it takes dedication, focus, and regular maintenance. We’ve narrowed this preparation down to 3 pillars for teams aiming for pay transparency readiness:</p>
<!--more-->
<h3>1. &nbsp;A Clear, Defensible Compensation Strategy</h3>
<p>At their core, pay transparency laws often come down to disclosing salary ranges - sounds simple enough, right? In reality, ensuring your ranges are accurate and appealing to the right talent requires more than a guess.</p>
<p>Salary ranges that attract the right talent and are ready to share should be grounded in a clear, consistently-applied strategy. The specific tactics of your compensation strategy should flow directly from your compensation philosophy and have well-defined, objective parameters. A robust compensation philosophy sets the non-negotiable standards for your entire pay program — defining your market position, setting the balance between base and variable pay (bonuses, incentives, equity), outlining how you maintain internal equity for similar work, determining policies for geographic differentials, and clarifying how pay increases and promotions align with individual and organizational performance.</p>
<p>Pay transparency requires organizations to openly share details about their compensation programs. Whether sharing an individual salary or a pay range, organizations must be able to explain the rationale behind their pay decisions. Moving beyond your compensation philosophy, job architecture provides the structure that brings it to life. Clearly defined roles, competencies, and job families clarify how positions relate, progress, and are compensated. This transparency helps employees understand differences in pay across levels and functions, and equips organizations to confidently stand behind their pay practices during internal discussions or external audits.</p>
<h3>2. Aligned, Relevant Market Data</h3>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">The market (not guesswork) should be the ultimate deciding factor for your salary ranges. Reliable survey data remains the gold standard for tracking market movement. Having accurate, recently matched, and competitive data provides a solid foundation for decision making Even the most experienced comp practitioners can’t know what every role “should” pay. Knowing where to find the right information (and then how to act on what it tells you) is what sets competitive compensation programs apart from those that fall behind. With the right data in hand, you can confidently share salary ranges that align with your employer brand and reflect the message your organization wants to send to the market.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;"">Managing large volumes of compensation data across dozens or hundreds of roles without a secure, centralized source of truth is nearly impossible. Investing in a market pricing solution provides critical benefits including efficiency, automation, and <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/bettercomps-commitment-to-data-security"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">security</a></span>. It also enables you to instantly generate <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/bridging-the-gap-between-data-and-decisions"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">reports</a></span>, so you can quickly analyze equity, fairness, and overall program health. With pay transparency accelerating, adopting processes that allow you to spot discrepancies early means you’ll have the opportunity to identify and rectify issues <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><em>before</em></span> a disclosure or an audit.</p>
<h3>3. Proactive, Frequent Research</h3>
<p>The regulatory landscape for compensation is a moving target. What works today will be out of date tomorrow. Compliance is no longer a one-time project; it’s a continuous monitoring process. You must track legislative changes (on local, state, and global levels) and assign responsibility for continuous monitoring of new and proposed pay transparency requirements. To make this process easier, <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://trusaic.com/resources/Global-Pay-Transparency-Center/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">Trusaic's Global Transparency Center</a></span> gathers updates and detailed guides on the pay transparency legislation for different regions around the globe.<br>Global employers walk a fine line between designing a robust, equitable compensation program and ensuring the flexibility to adapt ranges and policies quickly across different locations. As pay transparency laws evolve, each with unique disclosure requirements, <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/mastering-art-science-salary-range-modeling"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">range modeling</a></span> helps ensure ongoing compliance. By modeling potential changes before they’re enacted, your organization can adapt early, mitigate risk, and stay ahead of competitors.</p>
<p>Pay transparency isn’t a short-term trend, it’s a permanent, growing standard in how we approach compensation. Meeting compliance is only the first step. True success means using pay transparency to strengthen recruiting, deepen employee trust, and build a culture that retains top talent. When done right, transparency becomes a strategic advantage, not a compliance burden.<br><br></p>

Here at BetterComp, we see our clean SOC 2 Type II report as a powerful statement about our commitment to protecting our customers and their data. In today's digital landscape, where data security is a very real concern, this report confirms that while we’re innovating, we’re also maintaining the highest standards of trust and transparency.</span></p>
<!--more-->
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Protecting What Matters: Your Data, Your People</h2>
<p>Compensation professionals handle some of the most sensitive information within an organization. When your compensation team takes steps to protect your data, it’s actually an effort to protect your people. BetterComp was built to empower efficient compensation work, but we know that working faster can’t mean cutting corners — especially when it comes to your data. Finding newer, faster ways to accomplish market pricing and maintain internal equity needs to happen while maintaining the necessary safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of your critical data. Our unqualified SOC 2 Type II report is a reflection of this core principle: balancing innovation with unyielding security.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">What BetterComp’s Clean SOC 2 Report Means For Compensation Technology</h2>
<p>The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) developed the SOC 2 standard to evaluate whether an organization’s controls are effectively designed and operating as intended. BetterComp’s SOC 2 report covers: &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security: </strong>Safeguarding information and systems against unauthorized access, misuse, or disruption.</li>
<li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring systems are operational and accessible for their intended use.</li>
<li><strong>Confidentiality: </strong>Protecting sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our latest report confirms that an independent auditor has again verified our controls and found them to be consistently effective without any exceptions. This assurance is particularly vital for <span style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/market-pricing-at-scale-what-it-really-means"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">market pricing at scale</a></span>, which demands streamlined access to data without compromising security.</p>
<p>As we develop new features and expand our platform, security continues to be a guiding principle for our growth plans. We will continue to invest in our security infrastructure and processes, ensuring that as our customers’ needs evolve, our platform remains the most secure and trusted solution in the market. This unwavering focus allows you to leverage cutting-edge technology with complete confidence, knowing your most valuable asset — your people — are always protected.</p>

<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Can you share a brief overview of your professional background and how you ended up in your current role?</span></strong></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">I’ve been in tech sales for 6 years, but I started my sales career in college, where I did door-to-door and street canvassing for&nbsp;the&nbsp;Human Rights Campaign and Environment Massachusetts. After graduating from Simmons University, I managed teams in an ice cream shop and a coffee shop before shifting&nbsp;into tech sales.</span><br></span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Describe your role at BetterComp:</span></strong></h2>
<p>I manage the East SDR Team here at BetterComp. My day is usually filled with running 1:1s to connect with my team, holding mock calls, trainings, and team meetings, or strategizing about projects with the larger sales org, including rev ops and marketing.<br><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #222222;""></span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">What is your favorite part about your job and working at BetterComp?</span></strong></h2>
<p>My favorite part about being an SDR Manager at BetterComp is lifting up my team, helping them to be their best, and being a part of their journey as they grow. I started at BetterComp as an SDR and as I've worked and grown, I've been promoted and seen my role change - my goal is to foster that kind of growth across my team as well.&nbsp;My favorite part of working at BetterComp in general is the small startup environment where I can wear a lot of hats and see that I’m making change.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">What do you like doing when you’re not at work?</span></strong></h2>
<p>When I'm not at work, I like to hang out with my partner and our dog Spirit. I also play in pickleball and cornhole leagues and have been a regular at our local pub Trivia for 10 years.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">If you could give one piece of advice to someone just starting in your field, what would it be?</span></strong></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #222222;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">You’re here for a reason: Tech sales is a tough industry to get hired in. If you’re here, that means that you have the skills and the intelligence and the grit required to succeed in this job, and you have people who believe in you and are rooting for you. Don’t doubt that you belong here.</span><br></span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Is there a piece of advice you received early in your career that has stayed with you?<br></span></strong></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">“During my door to door days, our mantra was “one more door”. At this point, I’ve adopted a bit different wording for the phone, but with the same meaning: “When you’re done… make one more call”. There’s some kind of magic in showing up for yourself and your goals, in almost calling it quits but then saying, “Wait, I have it in me to do just one more!"" So many times, a meeting is booked on the very last call of the day, the one at 5:05PM after you said you would log off at 5PM. The sales gods surely look favorably upon those who show grit and determination - more so than this though, I think it’s a great habit to build with yourself. To push just a little harder, and show yourself you’re capable of more than you originally thought.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Share a couple of fun or surprising facts about yourself that your colleagues might not know.</span></strong></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">I have a dual degree in Art and Sociology. Although my career is not in these fields, they’re still very important to me. I fundraise every year for a local nonprofit called the EMA Fund in Massachusetts, and I make a lot of art in my free time: screen-printing shirts, making pottery, painting, embroidery, shrinky dinks, my house is like a 5th grade art classroom.</p>

Our recent (very official and scientific) poll on LinkedIn showed pay transparency beating out developments in AI and flex work as the trend that impacted comp pros the most over the past year.</span><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Blog%20Images/LinkedIn-Poll-PayTransparency.png"" width=""452"" height=""226"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""LinkedIn-Poll-PayTransparency"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 452px; margin: 15px auto; display: block;""></span></p>

<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span style=""color: black;"">Some leaders may think “pay transparency” is limited to sharing salaries on job postings. But with a growing number of pay gap reporting laws that put pay disparities on display, the impending EU Pay Transparency Directive that mandates pay equity analysis, remediation and communications, and cultural expectations that managers can clearly articulate why a person is paid what they are paid and why — the definition is broad and the implications transformational.</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>Today we’ll look at the two main factors driving the continued importance of pay transparency for compensation and HR teams:</span></p>
<ol style=""line-height: 1.75;"">
<li><span>Increasing adoption of pay transparency legislation across the globe </span></li>
<li><span>Shift in job seeker and employee expectations</span></li>
</ol>
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>We’ll start off with the regulatory side.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 30px;""><strong><span>Growth of Pay Transparency and Reporting Requirements</span></strong></h2>
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>Pay transparency and reporting requirements are becoming increasingly complex and widespread, which is transforming the world of compensation. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>Here’s what you should know as we begin the new year:</span></p>
<ol style=""line-height: 1.75;"">
<li><span>Pay gap reporting laws – new and modified – <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://synd.io/eu-pay-transparency/?utm_source=bettercomp&amp;utm_medium=partner&amp;utm_campaign=IC_2024_04_EU_Pay_Transparency"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;"">are set to </a><a href=""https://synd.io/eu-pay-transparency/"" style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;"">double</a><a href=""https://synd.io/eu-pay-transparency/"" style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;""> by 2027</a></span></span></li>

<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>With so much change in the regulatory landscape, partnering with trusted experts is crucial. At BetterComp, we collaborate with best-in-breed partners like Syndio to bring compensation teams solutions that help comp pros manage compensation data, implement fair pay practices, and ensure compliance with evolving regulations.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 30px;""><strong><span>Pay Transparency as a Cultural Phenomenon</span></strong></h2>
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>It’s not just regulations creating a push to pay transparency, it’s people. Legal mandates can create a forcing factor for companies, but ultimately, it’s the talent market that will cement pay transparency as more than a “nice-to-have” for companies. Compensation is the single largest line item in any company’s budget, and that’s because human capital is the driving force behind any company’s success. Attracting and retaining top talent is crucial, and in this environment, transparent pay practices are a must. </span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>This isn’t just my opinion; research backs it up. In a <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://resumelab.com/career-advice/financial-transparency"" style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">2023 report from Resume Lab</a></span>, 87% of respondents strongly or somewhat agreed that job postings should always include salary ranges and 80% said a lack of salary information would prevent them from applying for a role. A <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/why-you-should-include-salary-ranges-in-job-posts"" style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">2022 survey by LinkedIn</a> </span>was even harsher, showing 91% of respondents said that seeing salary ranges in a job posting affects their decision to apply.<img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Blog%20Images/PayTransparency-Banner.png"" width=""611"" height=""400"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""PayTransparency-Banner"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 611px; margin: 15px auto 0px; display: block;""></span></p>

<table height=""41"" style=""width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; table-layout: fixed; border: 1px solid #99acc2; height: 44px; border-style: none;"">

</div>
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>Even companies that operate in jurisdictions that don’t have pay transparency legislation are feeling the heat. While return-to-office (RTO) mandates are the big news, hybrid and remote work are still on the rise. That means for most jobs, your talent competition isn’t exclusively local to a specific office or location. Companies in, say, Texas are competing with those hiring in Washington, New York, Illinois, etc. for top talent. Remaining compliant with local regulations may not be enough to meet the expectations of your desired candidates.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 30px;""><strong><span>Pay Transparency in 2025 and Beyond</span></strong></h2>
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>So, what are we looking at for 2025? For starters, pay transparency isn’t going anywhere. While the incoming administration will almost certainly put a damper on the likelihood of any national legislation in the US, states and municipalities are certain to maintain or expand their regulatory mandates related to pay transparency and pay equity. And that’s not including the EU and other countries that are advancing pay transparency globally. </span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>Combine these factors with the expectations current and prospective employees have related to upfront disclosure of job ranges, transparent pay practices, and pay equity, and it’s safe to say this will remain a major factor influencing talent acquisition and retention. </span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.75;""><span>By embracing transparency and leveraging the right tools and expertise, companies can position themselves as leaders in competitive and fair pay practices and create a more engaged and equitable workforce. Staying informed and proactive is key to navigating the ever-changing world of pay transparency.</span></p>

<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #222222;"">I’ve been a compensation consultant, compensation practitioner, and CSM. I’ve spent time at Arthur Andersen, Mercer, American Express, Accenture (2x), and MarketPay/PayScale. I ended up at BetterComp because I wanted to re-join Sandra and other former MP/PS alum at this awesome company.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Describe your role at BetterComp:</span></strong></h2>
<p>I describe myself as a client partner. I work closely with my clients to ensure they are getting what they need out of BetterComp. My average day mirrors what is going on during the compensation season. Right now, I’m partnering with my clients on getting their data submitted to survey vendors. Besides my clients, I regularly interact with other members of the CS Team, especially our <span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #222222;"">awesome Implementation Managers.

<p>I. AM. A MOVIE. NERD. But not in a pretentious, “I only watch movies that have subtitles” kind of way. No, any and all of it. From the recent <em>Barbie</em>, <em>Dune</em>, and <em>Oppenheimer</em> movies to the films of the golden era. <em>Lawrence of Arabia</em> and <em>Doctor Zhivago</em> being 2 of my favorites from that time. I recently saw a Korean/French film called <em>Return to Seoul</em>. It took me for an unexpected ride, and for those 2 hours I was in a world that was not my own. That’s movies!</p>

With more than half of BetterComp customers using Workday for their HRIS and/or ERP solution, our partnership stands to be advantageous for our shared customers.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;"">A Long Time Vision</span></h2>
<p>As a former Workday employee (#764, and I have the coffee cup to prove it!), I understand how much Workday customers could benefit when their solutions have official partnerships with Workday.&nbsp; Workday partners have unique access to a Workday tenant (for testing and building integrations and use cases) and unique access to the Workday product management team fostering deeper and deeper benefits for mutual customers. Without that trusted partnership, customer’s Workday teams have to rely on integrations that aren’t with the benefit of a Workday tenant, which can lead to unreliable integrations that cause more work than they solve for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was with other companies in the market pricing space, we tried to forge a partnership with Workday, but we could never get any traction. Back then, our technology was already outdated and just too old and clunky, not at all aligned to the kind of partners that make up the Workday ecosystem. So this partnership is a long-time coming, but was actually pretty straightforward for BetterComp to pull off given our dozens of Fortune 500 customers that run Workday including Airbnb, Nvidia, and Target.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;"">Key Benefits</span></h2>
<p><span style=""color: #2f3139;""><strong>Enhanced Data Accuracy:</strong> By integrating BetterComp’s market pricing solution with Workday's comprehensive human capital management (HCM) system, we can access real-time employee and job data, ensuring the most accurate and up-to-date compensation insights. Our clients can make informed decisions based on the most up to date information, improving their market pricing accuracy and, ultimately, their market competitiveness.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #2f3139;""><strong>Streamlined Business Processes: </strong>BetterComp’s Workday facilitates seamless data transfer, eliminating manual processes and reducing the risk of errors. Clients will experience improved efficiency, enabling them to focus on strategic initiatives rather than mundane administrative tasks - all without involving their IT team.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #2f3139;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Actionable Insights: </span>The combined power of Workday's analytics capabilities and BetterComp’s compensation market pricing expertise will generate actionable insights for our mutual clients. Organizations can leverage these insights to align their compensation strategies with business goals, attract and retain top talent, and drive employee engagement and productivity.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #2f3139;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Continuous Innovation:</span> BetterComp’s partnership with Workday ensures that our compensation market pricing solutions will continually evolve and stay at the forefront of industry advancements. This commitment to ongoing innovation guarantees that our clients will always have access to cutting-edge solutions that drive their compensation strategies forward.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #2f3139;""><strong>Unparalleled Customer Support:</strong> We are dedicated to providing exceptional customer support, and this partnership reinforces our commitment. Our teams will work closely together to offer comprehensive support, ensuring our clients receive a seamless experience from implementation to ongoing maintenance</span><span style=""color: #2f3139;""></span></p>
<h2>Just Getting Started</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">Here at BetterComp, we’re just getting started on the innovation we’re bringing to the compensation industry. We’re excited about how far we’ve come in such a short amount of time and look forward to continuing to work with our customers and our partners to bring innovation forward.</span></p>

<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">Can you share a brief overview of your professional background and how you ended up in your current role?</span></strong></h2>
<p>I started my career consulting for SMB and enterprise engineering teams and was quickly drawn to the rapid rate of innovation in the startup space. As the breadth of my ownership increased I found a deep interest in people and culture. I’ve since spent the past 15+ years scaling engineering teams. The confluence of technical problems, culture, and people is where I love to be!&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">Describe your role at BetterComp:</span></strong></h2>
<p>As the VP of Engineering I am responsible for the efficient delivery of customer value through high quality software and infrastructure. I wake up early (5:00 AM) and get a jump start on the day spending about an hour catching up on Slack and email messages. I then spend an hour listening to audio books (largely psychology and AI these days) while I run/cycle. I then spend a few hours in meetings planning and coordinating efforts across teams and 1:1s with my team. I intentionally batch my calendar to have more meetings in mornings and earlier in the week leaving me blocks of creative time most afternoons and later in the week. To keep noise and context switching at a minimum, I also operate with my inbox/Slack at 0, meaning designated times I clear them out so I only leave messages needing response.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">What is your favorite part about your job? About working at BetterComp in general?&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p>That confluence of technical problems, culture, and people are where I thrive so I am on cloud 9 here! We have some amazing technical problems to solve, especially with the push into AI/ML driven solutions in addition to an amazing culture and people that we need to scale!&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">What do you like doing when you’re not at work?</span></strong></h2>
<p>My career is incredibly important to me and I get a great deal of fulfillment from it, but when I am not engaged with work I split my time between my wife Bonnie, and our dog Lady, and Mountaineering. Mountaineering requires a pretty consistent training schedule so keeps me very busy climbing, running, cycling, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold;"">How do you continue to learn and grow in your role? Are there any particular skills or areas you're currently focused on improving?</h2>
<p>I’m always improving but tend to apply a version of constraints theory to where so I’m always focused on the most impactful thing for me. Tactically that is learning our platform and understanding our customers at the moment.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold;"">If you could give one piece of advice to someone just starting in your field, what would it be?</h2>
<p>Develop the skills to learn quickly with a continuous learning mindset. Our industry moves too fast and too many people get stuck on learning specific technologies over developing the skills to learn more effectively. Adopt a First Principles&nbsp;approach coupled with Systems Thinking&nbsp;to quickly and effectively understand new ideas, concepts, and problem spaces. Also, learn to use “AI” and do so in a way that you actually understand it and can leverage it to make you more impactful.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">Share a few fun or surprising facts about yourself that your colleagues might not know.</span></strong><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p>A few fun facts about me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve climbed all 58 peaks over 14,000 ft in Colorado, Matterhorn in Switzerland, and Pico De Orizaba in Mexico.</li>
<li>I played poker for a living after high school for a couple years which ultimately paid for my move to California,.</li>
<li>I received the largest youth entrepreneurship grant the state of MN issued when I was 16 years old to start a skate park in the town I lived in. Utopia skate park is still there today, free, for kids to use!&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">What’s your favorite book/movie/TV show and why is it your favorite?</span></strong><span style=""color: #474554;""></span></h2>
<p>The Righteous Mind is a book by Jonathan Haidt that outlines the challenges people have disagreeing effectively. Strongly backed with studies it is a book that everyone should read to help us better understand each other and ultimately foster more inclusive environments to respectfully agree and disagree.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

In the past, organizations in the United States relied primarily on internal job evaluation methods to assess the value of a role based on its relative importance within the organization. Now with compensation data so much more readily available, most companies are looking beyond their walls to see how their pay practices compare to others in the market.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In this blog, we will explore both the external and internal job evaluation methods independently and discuss how you can strike a balanced approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style=""font-size: 36px; font-weight: normal;""><span style=""color: #474554;"">Internal Job Evaluation: The Point Factor Method</span></h1>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Internal%20Job%20Evaluation%20Graphic%20BetterComp.png"" width=""300"" height=""300"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Internal Job Evaluation Graphic BetterComp"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 300px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">There are many different ways to do an <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.shrm.org/topics-tools/tools/toolkits/performing-job-evaluations"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">internal job evaluation.</a></span> One of the most common techniques is the point factor method. At a very high-level, <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.ebsco.com/sites/default/files/acquiadam-assets/Pathways-to-Research-Business-Sample-Job-Evaluation.pdf"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">this involves</a></span> identifying key compensable factors—such as skills, responsibilities, effort, and working conditions—and assigning each factor a weight and point value based on its importance to the company. The total points then determine the relative worth of a job within the organization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the major benefits of the point factor method is the ability to promote internal equity. The point factor method is a clear, measurable way to evaluate each job, ensuring that roles with similar responsibilities and requirements are compensated equally. This fosters a sense of fairness across the organization.</p>
<p>However, relying solely on internal evaluations can be limiting. Maintaining internal equity is mission critical, but it’s not the only consideration in today’s market. That’s where market-based compensation comes into play.</p>
<h1 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;""><span style=""font-weight: normal; color: #474554;"">External Job Evaluation: Market-Based Compensation</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></h1>

With this approach, companies gather and analyze market data to assess how similar roles are being compensated and align employee salaries accordingly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several advantages to this approach, a major one being market competitiveness. Regular assessment of the external labor market helps companies stay informed about salary trends and changes in demand, enabling them to make more timely adjustments that attract and retain talent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a successful market-based approach depends on having access to relevant, reliable compensation data, as well as a process to manage, analyze, and update that data regularly. Without this in place, it can become easy to make misinformed or out-of-date compensation decisions.</p>

<h1 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;""><span style=""font-weight: normal; color: #474554;"">The Need for a Balanced Approach</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></h1>
<p>Many comp pros today are aiming for a hybrid approach that merges the best of both worlds—market competitiveness with internal equity—without overextending the budget.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A major driving force behind this shift is the rise of pay transparency, which has brought compensation out of the shadows and into the spotlight. More than ever before, comp pros need to make pay decisions that can withstand scrutiny. This has increased the demand for compensation data, because a data-driven approach not only provides a more comprehensive view of the market, but also allows comp pros to justify compensation decisions using evidence.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Pay%20Transparency%20Image%202024.png"" width=""230"" height=""230"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Pay Transparency Image 2024"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 230px; float: right; margin: 0px 20px 11px;"">Pay transparency has also significantly amplified the importance of maintaining&nbsp;internal equity. With salaries being shared more openly, discrepancies are much easier to identify. Pay transparency is much more than just being legally compliant. It plays a critical role in shaping the <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/compensation-can-make-or-break-employer-brand"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;"">employer brand</a></span> and ability to attract, retain, and motivate talent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given this reality today, comp pros cannot ignore the external market completely. Even if they cannot pay at or above market rates, understanding where they stand helps identify gaps, adjust compensation strategies, and communicate more effectively with both stakeholders and employees.</p>
<p>At the same time, having an internal job evaluation process in place is crucial for maintaining internal equity. Having a consistent internal structure can help ensure that pay reflects the responsibilities, skills, and impact each role brings to the organization.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style=""font-size: 36px; font-weight: normal;""><span style=""color: #474554;"">3 Steps for Finding the Balance&nbsp;</span></h1>
<p>A successful compensation strategy that strikes the right balance between external market competitiveness and internal equity requires 3 key components.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #002071;""><strong>1. Use data that is both reliable and relevant.</strong></span></h3>
<p>There is an abundance of data sources and data providers today, but not all of it will be reliable and not all of it will be relevant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reliable data is accurate and trustworthy, achieved through meticulous data collection, analysis, and validation, as well as transparency in the methodologies used. Traditional surveys are still considered to be the gold-standard data source in terms of reliability, but even then you need to identify the <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/how-to-identify-the-right-salary-survey-data-for-your-company"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;"">right survey(s) for your company.</a></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px; color: #474554;"">Comp teams not only need to choose between traditional surveys, but also have a variety of alternative data sources to consider. Each of these data sources have their own pros and cons.

<p>Additionally, <a href=""/blog/webinar-recap-navigating-data-diversity-alternative-data-sources-best-practices"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>our <span style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;"">recent webinar</span></span></a> brought together comp pros to discuss use cases and best practices for leveraging data. Some of the main takeaways from that session include: 1) making sure the data you choose aligns with your business needs and 2) selecting data sets that are relevant to your company profile (eg. companies of similar size and industry).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using reliable and relevant data as the foundation for your compensation strategy is vital for effectively balancing market competitiveness with internal equity. This solid groundwork helps ensure that your compensation decisions align with your company goals and are justifiable, fostering trust within your organization.</p>

<p>With compensation, it’s rarely one-and-done. Regular reviews of your company’s pay philosophy and strategy can help maintain market competitiveness and internal equity by enabling you to:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Stay in tune with market trends&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Identify gaps and disparities earlier</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Make sure pay practices remain aligned with company goals</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Make necessary adjustments in a timely manner&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>Having a pre-established schedule for conducting reviews can help maintain accountability. At the minimum, pay practices should be reviewed at least once a year but this should increase during any moments of significant organizational or economical change (eg. mergers &amp; acquisitions, rapid growth, and more).&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #002071;""><strong>3. Leverage a technology partner.</strong></span></h3>
<p>Compensation decisions have a direct impact on a company’s bottom line. This is a lot of pressure on comp pros, but you don’t have to navigate this alone. Leveraging the expertise and resources of a technology partner can make all the difference here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The key here is to work with a technology partner and not just a software vendor. The right technology will provide the capabilities to do your job more effectively and efficiently - whether that is automating manual tasks, providing robust reporting, enabling smooth integrations or more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The right partner<em> </em>will provide industry expertise, tailored support for your company’s unique challenges, and foster a long-term relationship focused on continuous improvement.</p>
<p>At BetterComp, we are built by comp pros for comp pros and we take pride in being your technology partner for all your market pricing needs.

To walk this line, compensation teams have a variety of tools available, including market benchmark data from salary surveys, internal processes, and models to analyze the potential effect of changes to compensation.

<h2><span style=""color: #474554;"">What is Range Modeling?</span></h2>
<p><a href=""https://www.bettercomp.com/compensation-market-pricing-guide""><span><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Woman-data-modeling.jpg"" width=""600"" height=""324"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Woman-data-modeling"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 600px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px; float: left;""><span style=""color: #3473f2;"">Market pricing</span></span></a> and range modeling are interconnected concepts that form the foundation of an effective compensation strategy. Like gears in a well-oiled machine, one contributes to the effectiveness of the other. While market pricing looks <em>externally</em> to determine the fair market value of a job, range modeling channels that external market data to build an<em> internal</em> compensation framework that ensures competitive and equitable pay for employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A critical component of range modeling is defining and analyzing salary ranges. Salary ranges provide companies a framework to conceivably reward high performers with merit increases and adapt for market changes all while controlling overall costs. Depending on company size, philosophy, and business objectives, compensation teams may choose to implement traditional, job based, or market-based ranges.</p>
<h2>Why is Range Modeling Important?</h2>
<p>As much as compensation is an art, it’s also a science; that’s where range modeling comes in. Compensation leaders need to formulate hypotheses and test out many various scenarios—like different midpoint salaries or range widths—before implementing changes. <img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Stock%20Photography/laptop-global-data.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""252"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""laptop-global-data"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 300px; float: right; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;""></p>
<p>This is because even the seemingly small changes&nbsp;in your data can have large implications at both the organizational and employee level. For example, changing employee salaries will have a direct impact on company payroll and Compensation teams need to be prepared to justify that decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being able to test out various models and assess different potential outcomes provides peace of mind knowing that compensation decisions are backed by data.</p>
<h2>Range Modeling Use Cases</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">There are a number of points at which range modeling is critical to Compensation teams. These include standard practices like annual merit or cost-of-living modeling to large, strategic initiatives such as a company-wide overhaul of the compensation structure.</span></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">Year-Over-Year Merit Increases</span></h3>
<p>The most common use for range modeling occurs every year. Companies typically have a cyclical process for reassessing employees’ base salaries to determine if they warrant adjustment. Most commonly, this is an annual process, but more companies are looking to off-cycle and semi-annual evaluations to stay ahead of a tight talent market and rapidly shifting economy.&nbsp;</p>

Many compensation teams are cautiously curious about how AI could save them time, but also nervous about exactly how to bring this new technology into their existing processes.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">A significant risk of AI adoption is the undervaluation of human expertise, which could lead to poor compensation decisions. AI, especially large language models (LLMs), can generate sophisticated-sounding but incorrect information. LLMs often predict how to finish sentences based on consumed words, rather than engaging in true legal reasoning or understanding principles. That means that if inaccurate information gets plugged in, inaccurate information comes out… and we all know that working with inaccurate information can lead to massive time-wasting and more work than it’s worth.&nbsp;</span></p>

Identifying which type of calculations are necessary will help you determine which models are going to be most impactful for your team.</span><span style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 24px;""></span></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 24px;""><strong>2. Establish Clear Governance.&nbsp;</strong></span><br>Collaborate with your IT and security teams to implement simple governance practices and principles, specifying when and how large language models should or should not be used. Next, provide education for all users on basic IP law and the risks of inputting sensitive or proprietary data into public AI models, as this can lead to serious legal consequences and security risks.</span><br><span style=""font-size: 18px;""></span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 24px;""><strong>3. Recognize Current Usage and Build Data Literacy.</strong>&nbsp;</span><br>Evaluate the data literacy and expertise of individuals who will be using AI systems, especially for high-risk applications that affect compensation and livelihoods. Acknowledge that employees are likely already using AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) despite policies that attempt to deter their usage. Instead of an ""on-off switch"" approach, build up your team’s basic data literacy and understanding of how these tools work.</span><span style=""font-size: 18px;""></span><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;""></span></span></p>

"Navigating the AI Landscape: Considerations for Compensation Work","Navigating the AI Landscape: Considerations for Compensation Work","https://www.bettercomp.com/blog/navigating-the-ai-landscape-considerations-for-compensation-work","BetterComp CEO Alan Miegel recently joined a panel of experts from Trusaic and Norton Rose Fullbright about considerations for AI use in compensation work.","2025-08-13 06:45:02","<p>I recently moderated a webinar with <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://trusaic.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">Trusaic’s</a></span> John Ford and <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.nortonrosefulbright.com/en-us"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">Norton Rose Fulbright’s</a></span> Andy Cripe all about the evolving landscape of AI and its implications for compensation and HR. While we celebrated the immense potential of AI, we also dove into the critical considerations for responsible adoption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<h3>The Rapid Rate of AI Innovation vs. The Slow and Steady Grind of Law</h3>
<p>One of the central themes emphasized by panelist Andy Cripe is the stark contrast between the fast-paced development of AI and the much slower evolution of law. While massive investments are being poured into AI in the private sector and by governments (specifically a whopping <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://hai.stanford.edu/ai-index/2025-ai-index-report"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">$109 billion in private sector spending in the US in 2025</a></span>), the legal framework governing AI is still largely based on existing laws applicable to human decision-making. This means organizations won't find a single, comprehensive ""AI law"" but rather an expanding list of regulations trying to keep pace with new challenges.</p>
<h4>Four Key Legal Concerns for AI in HR &amp; Compensation Work</h4>
<p>To help compensation professionals maneuver the legality of AI usage, Andy outlined four major areas of legal concern for using AI in employment and pay-related purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data Privacy and Compliance: </strong>While often the first concern, Andy suggested this &nbsp;might not be the biggest issue. Because robust frameworks like <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.compliancepoint.com/services/privacy/?utm_term=gdpr%20compliance&amp;utm_campaign=Virtual+Privacy&amp;utm_source=adwords&amp;utm_medium=ppc&amp;hsa_acc=8022846127&amp;hsa_cam=19789989103&amp;hsa_grp=150468685647&amp;hsa_ad=671939887088&amp;hsa_src=g&amp;hsa_tgt=kwd-296653425760&amp;hsa_kw=gdpr%20compliance&amp;hsa_mt=b&amp;hsa_net=adwords&amp;hsa_ver=3&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=19789989103&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADSVJaBIVU9hTsELPS7vjfFmc1B-Z&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjws4fEBhD-ARIsACC3d2_0PownH7v6t4GgdzA8YACcEMSSgW5khFYRSmiTdvQ1VO8SiEHjO9IaAsFHEALw_wcB"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">GDPR in Europe</a></span> and various US state laws (such as those in <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">California</a></span> or <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.varonis.com/blog/illinois-privacy-law"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">Illinois</a></span>) already address data collection, maintenance, transfer, and usage with an emphasis on consent and security. However, the increasing emergence of data use policies shows a growing need for AI tool assessments.</li>
<li><strong>Bias and Discrimination:</strong> A significant risk is algorithmic bias, where AI models trained on existing data sets can produce skewed outcomes, leading to disparate impacts on groups of employees. This is particularly relevant for compensation and ensuring pay fairness! Regular statistical analysis and human involvement is crucial to avoid AI-created imbalances.</li>
<li><strong>Unfair Dealing, Deceptive Practices, or Fraud: </strong>This was highlighted as potentially the most significant, yet least discussed, legal issue. The ""black box problem"" of AI (where human decisions appear to be made but are merely adopting unaccountable AI outputs) can lead to false, misleading, or dishonest practices. This can occur when employees use generative AI tools without proper disclosure or understanding. Evaluating your team’s AI usage and educating them on when these tools are appropriate will help keep reliable, human decisions where they’re needed.</li>
<li><strong>IP Protection:</strong> AI systems can collect and use vast amounts of information, raising concerns about data ownership and intellectual property. You can’t just load data from your survey vendors into any generative AI tool — that’s going to violate vendor agreements and compromise the safety of your data!<br><br></li>
</ol>
<h3>AI's Role in Enhancing Compensation Work</h3>
<p>When used responsibly, AI can significantly enhance compensation work in several areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data Analysis: AI tools can provide plain language narrative descriptions of statistical results, making complex data more accessible to users.</li>
<li>Pay Fairness: AI can help model different scenarios for pay fairness issues, allowing organizations to quickly understand the potential impact of various compensation decisions across large workforces. This provides insights at scale that would be impossible for humans alone.</li>
<li>Job Matching and Architecture: AI can assist in <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/webinar-recap-job-architecture-and-survey-data"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">matching internal jobs to survey jobs</a></span> or other datasets and identifying similar internal jobs to prevent ""bloat"" in job catalogs.</li>
<li>Anomaly Detection: After compensation processes are complete, AI can identify outlier adjustments, such as top performers receiving no increase or those at the bottom of the range receiving nothing.</li>
</ul>
<p>We wrapped up the webinar with the message that <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/what-ai-means-for-compensation"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">AI should support, not replace, human decision-making</a></span>. Our whole panel agreed that a practical, human-centered approach to AI adoption is essential to mitigating risks and maximizing benefits. Collaborate with external and internal advisors to identify well-vetted AI tools that genuinely enhance productivity and improve results!</p>

With rapid changes and huge opportunities for nearly every industry, AI is being met with excitement and skepticism all at once. For compensation professionals, there are obvious concerns about data safety, but there is also growing interest in how AI can help simplify some of the monotonous tasks that consume comp teams’ time.</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">When it comes to AI, one important thing to remember is that AI isn’t just generative models like ChatGPT. It’s an array of technologies that allow computers to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving. It analyzes vast amounts of data to identify patterns and relationships, enabling it to make predictions, automate processes, and generate insights.&nbsp;<br></span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">At its core, AI is about automation, but understanding the potential impact of these automations can be tricky. Where does it fit in? How does it actually improve comp work?</span><span style=""font-size: 18px;""></span></p>
<!--more-->
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Preparing for the Future of Compensation</h2>
<p>Compensation programs have to be agile. Last year’s plans won’t work again without adjustment, but somehow many compensation professionals are relying on the same technology to support their work that they were using five, ten, even twenty years ago. Employee expectations, budgets, pay transparency policies, pay equity regulations, and job architectures change and shift, but the technology used to make all of those elements work together hasn’t kept pace.</p>
<p>Even with the demand for agility, there are a lot of compensation tasks that take time. Analyze data, generate reports, share insights… repeat. Technology empowers compensation professionals to work more efficiently, and AI can take some of the routine tasks off their plates altogether. For instance, instead of digging into every data point to evaluate pay disparities, AI tools could evaluate full data sets and pinpoint the exact pay gaps compensation professionals should remedy. However, you can’t just pop your survey or employee data into any platform and allow AI to work its magic. AI can help speed up processes in alignment with company goals and compliance needs, but only when paired with human guidance and security measures.</p>
<p>Since we started BetterComp, our team has been dedicated to providing dynamic compensation technology, and <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/bettercomps-new-33m-in-series-a-funding"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">our recent $33M in Series A funding</a></span> is going to supercharge how quickly we innovate. We're excitedly looking to find ways we can help bring more automation and AI to the world of compensation and are working to pair AI with the necessary data protections.</p>
<p>Right now, AI’s possibilities seem endless and we’re just seeing the beginnings of what it can do. One thing we can be sure of is that it won’t replace the need for humans. Bringing AI into the world of compensation isn’t about eliminating the people behind great comp programs; its purpose will be empowering them with unprecedented tools and data. By embracing AI, compensation professionals can shift their focus from repetitive, manual tasks to strategic, high-value work and become true advisors, using AI-generated insights to craft personalized, fair, and competitive total rewards packages that attract and retain top talent. BetterComp is thrilled to help compensation teams move faster and work smarter with cutting-edge AI innovations.</p>

They meticulously analyze data, build intricate pay structures, and ensure fairness and competitiveness. But often, comp&nbsp;work remains behind the scenes, perceived as a ""task-driven department"" rather than an ""essential partner.""</p>
<p>The key to shifting this perception lies in understanding and communicating the ""why"" behind your compensation strategy and the data that drives it. Compensation isn’t just about crunching numbers, it's about translating those numbers into a compelling narrative that resonates with every internal stakeholder.<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></p>
<!--more-->
<h3>The Power of the ""Why"" in Compensation</h3>
<p>I recently moderated a webinar with leaders from <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://synd.io/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">Syndio</a></span> and <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.fticonsulting.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">FTI Consulting</a></span> where we discussed how to analyze the alignment between a compensation strategy and a company's most important goals. We also dove into how <a href=""/blog/bridging-the-gap-between-data-and-decisions"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #3473f2;"">effective reporting</span></a> makes this alignment visible. Imagine being able to clearly articulate why a particular compensation decision was made, rather than just stating the outcome. As Nancy Romanyshyn, Senior Director of Total Rewards Strategy and Solutions at Syndio, highlighted, it's necessary to ask yourself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">""Why are we making this decision, and can I explain it in a way that makes sense, that doesn't descend into comp speak?""</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While compensation professionals are adept at pulling insights from vast amounts of data, translating that information for diverse audiences (from executive leadership to employees) is where the real challenge lies. Reporting needs to go beyond raw figures and provide clear, actionable insights that demonstrate value and drive understanding.</p>
<h3>Beyond the Numbers: Reports that Tell a Story</h3>
<p>When presenting compensation information, empathy is key. As panelist Warren Mueller, FTI Consulting’s Senior Director of Global Compensation, suggested, ""Put yourself in the shoes of the person you're talking to. What do they want to hear?""</p>
<p>Reporting is about moving from a ""push"" mentality of delivering information to considering what the receiver needs to understand and what their action items will be.</p>
<p>For instance, when addressing pay discrepancies, a clear, leadership-approved compensation philosophy with pillars like ""market-driven,"" ""transparent,"" and ""fair and equitable"" can provide the ""why"" behind decisions. This philosophy serves as the guiding principle for all pay programs and helps explain decisions when questions arise.</p>
<h3>Shifting from Practitioner to Strategist</h3>
<p>Ultimately, for compensation to make the move from being a siloed, back-office function to a strategic level that leaders turn to for solutions involves:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplifying Comp Design:</strong> Narrowing wide pay bands and considering function-based ranges can streamline communication and reduce discrepancies.</li>
<li><strong>Empowering Front-line Communicators: </strong>Managers and recruiters are the ""tip of the spear"" for compensation programs. They need to be confident and well-versed in the compensation philosophy to effectively communicate offers and explain pay decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Embracing a Marketing Mindset: </strong>Compensation professionals need to ""market"" their programs by building a compelling narrative around their value and ensuring internal buy-in.</li>
</ul>
<p>The world of compensation is challenging, with evolving regulations, technology, and leadership expectations. However, by focusing on the ""why"" behind our reporting, embracing empathy in our communication, and leveraging technology, compensation professionals can elevate their impact and truly become essential partners in driving business success.<span style=""color: #000000;""></span></p>

While spreadsheets are flexible and cost-effective, their <a href=""/blog/why-spreadsheets-dont-cut-it-for-comp"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #3473f2;"">limitations become glaring as companies grow</span></a> and compensation plans become more complex.

<h3>Stepping Toward a Smarter Future</h3>
<p>Your compensation program has to adapt to your organization’s future, and we can’t predict the future! Laying a strong foundation through a clear compensation philosophy and robust <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/webinar-recap-job-architecture-and-survey-data"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">job architecture</a></span> creates a steady program that can withstand changes to pay transparency and equity regulations, organizational growth, and shifts in the talent market. Smart systems like BetterComp and Decusoft are designed specifically for compensation teams and offer tailored solutions to help you keep the foundation of your compensation program strong, while also expanding and scaling your program as your team grows.</p>
<p>The capabilities of compensation technology surpass spreadsheets when it comes to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tailored Workflows: </strong>They address all aspects of compensation, including salary, merit, bonuses, equity, and various incentive plans (STIP, LTIP), all in one place.</li>
<li><strong>Configurability: </strong>Unlike custom-built solutions, these platforms are configurable, allowing for quick adaptations without constant IT involvement.</li>
<li><strong>Built-in Governance: </strong>With features like role-based access, audit trails, and automated rule enforcement, they eliminate manual checks and version control headaches.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time Data and Analytics: </strong>Users gain instant visibility into budgets, pay equity, and performance alignment through live dashboards and <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/bridging-the-gap-between-data-and-decisions"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">reporting</a></span>.</li>
<li><strong>AI-Powered Insights:</strong> These systems go beyond automation, offering predictive insights, recommending specific actions, detecting anomalies, and providing natural language interfaces for intuitive data exploration. They learn and refine recommendations over time, ensuring smarter and fairer decisions.</li>
<li><strong>Seamless Integration:</strong> Smart systems integrate with an organization's entire HR tech stack, including HRIS, performance management tools, survey providers, and finance systems, creating a single source of truth.</li>
</ul>
<p>One important point to remember when it comes to smart comp systems is data. The data is what keeps these systems smart. Bringing together internal data, external survey data, and compensation expertise into one integrated system is crucial for generating actionable insights and maintaining a competitive edge.</p>
<h3>Is Your Compensation Program Ready for a Smart System?</h3>
<p>Determining your program’s readiness for a smart system comes down to how complex managing, communicating, and strategizing compensation is for your team. Having diverse review and approval workflows, employees working in a variety of locations, and increasing employee headcount (especially beyond 200-500 employees) are strong indicators that it’s time to leave spreadsheets behind.</p>
<p>Leveling your compensation program up to a smart compensation system is not just a tech upgrade. It's a strategic move to help your organization navigate today's talent market and prepare for future growth.<span style=""color: #000000;""></span></p>

<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">We set out to create a compensation technology platform that turned market pricing into a scalable practice for compensation teams. We wanted our (then future) customers to have both easy access to their critical data and simplify how they use it to drive pay decisions. We even coined the term<em> </em><span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/market-pricing-at-scale-what-it-really-means"" rel=""noopener"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">“market pricing at scale”</a></span> to describe that process. </span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">After years in the industry, we saw how, despite employee compensation taking up the lion’s share of any given company’s budget, it hadn’t received the same kind of tech advancements that other areas of HR got to experience. We wanted to build a platform that helps compensation professionals move out of the time-intensive tasks that come with building a strong comp program and give them more time to focus on strategy.</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Since our founding, lots of things have changed. Our technology has undergone major upgrades and innovation, our customer base has grown rapidly, we’ve created a dynamic partner ecosystem, and our headcount has increased to meet the needs of our customers. However, one thing remained constant: our goal of making compensation Better.</span></p>

<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">New Funding Sparks Even More Expansion</h2>
<p>Our growth from idea to “force to be reckoned with in comp tech” has recently<span style=""color: #3473f2;""> </span><a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250721198160/en/BetterComp-Secures-%2433M-Seri[…]pand-into-New-Markets-Advance-AI-in-Compensation-Practices"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span style=""color: #3473f2;"">led us to a new Series A funding round, led by Ten Coves Capital</span></a>. We just announced our $33M in funding and are excited to use this funding to fuel more innovation, expansion, and growth. Prior to this round, we self funded with $1.75m in non-dilutive funding from <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://founderpath.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">Founderpath</a></span>.</p>
<p>We know that “better” is a moving target, so BetterComp is going to remain nimble and adaptable to bring the best possible solutions to compensation. Because every compensation program is unique, we’ve always worked to build a platform that helps all teams market price their roles, regardless of how many surveys they participate in or where their employees are located. Our new funding empowers us to expand to new markets and bring modern compensation technology to teams around the globe.</p>
<h3>Adding More AI to Our Innovation Plans</h3>
<p>With our new funding, we’re doubling down on AI—building tools that empower compensation professionals to work smarter, faster, and with greater confidence. Designed with security and accountability at the core, these innovations will help teams stay ahead in an increasingly complex comp landscape.</p>
<p>We have a lot of pride in the modern, malleable platform we’ve built, and we have the architecture to support true AI innovation. Our new funding is going to help us advance even faster than we were advancing before (and we’ve been <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7333192968851361792"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">moving pretty quickly</a></span>).</p>
<p>If we looked back at the product we first built in 2019, it was met with excitement and interest from compensation professionals. Technology has changed (including our own), time has passed, but we’re still looking forward to continuing to hear how we’re making market pricing faster, without asking anyone to compromise their time or gloss over any of the necessary steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re excited to share the news of our Series A funding and while we celebrate, we are keeping our mission at the forefront of our work. We’re keeping our momentum and still striving to build a platform that grows with comp teams’ needs.</p>

"Market Pricing at Scale: What It Really Means","Market Pricing at Scale: What It Really Means","https://www.bettercomp.com/blog/market-pricing-at-scale-what-it-really-means","BetterComp sets the standard for true market pricing at scale.","2025-07-14 11:00:01","<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">How ""Market Pricing at Scale"" Became Industry Gold</h2>
<p>Comp pros have a lot on their plates. Ever-changing expectations, priorities, and market shifts add fuel to the fire, making their growing list of day-to-day tasks harder to accomplish, especially with limited tooling. The echoed need for automated, scalable market pricing fueled one of BetterComp’s many innovations: <em><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">market pricing at scale.&nbsp;</span></em><br><br>This phrase has become so powerful that it’s recently been adopted by competing vendors; however, what it <em>actually </em>means varies from vendor to vendor.<br><br>In general, “at scale” can be used to describe any task that can be done across the board, in bulk, or at a large capacity. Through the lens of a compensation professional, it relates to making the task of pricing one job automatically repeatable across various geographies, ideally with minimal effort. Several CompTech vendors list this as a capability, but the true defining factor is if the platform empowers comp pros with flexibility and dynamic adjustments.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></p>
<!--more--><h3>Buzzword vs. Core Capability</h3>
<p>If we pull back the curtain on competing solutions, users can <em>technically </em>market price at scale, extending one job match across PayMarkets with minimal effort. However, end-users can’t <em>reprice at scale </em>with mass changes — changes that are required for most comp pros.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Picture this: you’ve priced all of your jobs using a national data cut. Now, leadership wants all IT jobs priced to a tech data cut, keeping all other job functions priced to national data.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>""At Scale"" in Hours vs. Minutes</h3>
<p>With this new task at hand, market pricing at scale in other solutions is a one-way street with significant limitations. Repricing your IT job family to a tech data cut means you have to reprice all IT jobs, job by job, PayMarket by PayMarket.</p>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/1-2.png"" width=""1920"" height=""1080"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""1-2"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 1920px;""></p>
<p>Changing the game for compensation professionals, BetterComp’s dynamic and flexible approach to market pricing at scale means extensive time savings, scalability, and confidence for end-users. Codifying and pre-configuring your organization's unique guidelines and pricing principles ensures consistent processes across the organization, enabling users to apply different data cuts to different locations, easily change data cuts for entire job families or PayMarkets, and instantly compare results <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">with a single click</span>.<br><br>We’ve eliminated the need for spreadsheets and cumbersome manual workarounds often seen in competing solutions, moving from rigid job code keys to flexible PayMarkets, and from data cut priorities in Excel sheets to pre-configured roll-up policies.</p>
<h3>What This Means for You</h3>
<p>So, imagine you’re being asked to reprice your jobs once a week instead of once a year. Maybe you’re adding real-time data into the mix, data providers are shipping more frequently, or your company is entering a new market with new roles. If your market pricing tool can’t keep pace with constant change, requiring manual work every time a change needs to be made, it hinders your ability to scale with confidence and efficiency.<br><br>By automating data cut selections with codified policies, BetterComp helps organizations unlock scalability, consistency, and confidence in their market pricing, ensuring effective budget allocation through granular, job-level data and freeing up time for other critical tasks.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Ultimately, choosing a vendor that can effectively enable automated and simplified market pricing at scale is paramount for future-proofing your compensation strategy.</span></p>

As far back as the early 90s, the idea of “telework” or “telecommuting” was taking root. Since then, remote work - whether full time or on a part time / hybrid basis - has been gaining traction, though slowly.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p style=""font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5;"">That pace changed in 2020 when COVID-19 closed offices and forced remote work on large segments of the population. The massive shift to remote work proved that the majority of today’s workers are just as productive in a home-based environment as they are in an office. It also showcased the value of working remotely to employees. As a result, companies are increasingly exploring the idea of shifting to&nbsp; fully distributed teams on a more permanent basis. Backing this up, a survey of HR leaders by <span style=""color: #355bba;""><a href=""https://www.conference-board.org/topics/natural-disasters-pandemics/reimagined-workplace-two-years-later-2022"" style=""text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #355bba;"">The Conference Board</a><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span></span>found that just 4% said they were requiring all employees to return to the office.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px; line-height: 1.5;"">But with this shift comes the challenge of redesigning compensation practices and policies to suit a newly distributed workforce. As your company looks to the future of work, it’s critical to develop a compensation plan and structure that suits your culture, your budget, and your employees.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #474554;""><strong>Why Remote?</strong></span></h2>
<img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Man-works-at-home-with-daughter.jpg"" alt=""Man-works-at-home-with-daughter"" width=""320"" loading=""lazy"" style=""color: #2f3139; font-size: 16px; width: 320px; float: right; margin: 10px 15px;"">
<p style=""line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Over the past couple years, employees&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">have taken to&nbsp;remote work.&nbsp;They appreciate the flexibility and independence it provides, the time saved in commuting, and even the cost savings related to transportation and parking. But a remote workforce has benefits for employers, as well.</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">While things like reducing overhead by minimizing or eliminating office space and cost savings related to transportation or parking allowances are nice, the real value organizations see in either hybrid or fully remote teams is related to attracting and retaining talent. According to World at Work’s <span style=""color: #355bba;""><a href=""https://worldatwork.org/resources/research/surveys/geographic-pay-policies-study"" style=""text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold; color: #355bba;"">2022 Geographic Pay Policies Study</a></span>, 38% of employees would consider looking for new employment if remote work arrangements were discontinued. That number is disputed by a recent <a href=""https://www.adpri.org/research/people-at-work-2022-a-global-workforce-view/"" style=""text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: #355bba; text-decoration: underline;"">ADP Research Institute survey</span></a>, which put it even higher, at 64%. Hiring remotely also opens up your talent pool, giving you access to prospective employees from across the country, continent, or around the globe who otherwise might not have considered your company.</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">However, remote work isn’t suitable for all companies and positions. Industries like healthcare, manufacturing, and retail all require employees to be physically present to complete their work. And even some jobs that <em style=""background-color: transparent; display: inline !important;"">could </em>be done remotely may benefit from the hallway conversations and collaboration offices can offer. These are important considerations when determining whether to institute a more permanent remote work policy.</span></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.5; font-size: 16px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Once you’ve determined whether to implement remote work permanently, it’s time to address compensation.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong>Evaluate Your Options for Remote Work Compensation</strong></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Historically, compensation is largely determined by location and cost of living. For example, a human resources director living in Chicago is likely to make more money than someone doing the same job while living in Tulsa. When everyone was working in offices, managing compensation based by location was relatively simple; however the shift to remote work adds layers of complexity. That World at Work study I mentioned previously also showed that more than half of companies with existing geographic pay policies recently modified or are considering modifications to comp policies due to the increase of full-time remote work.</span></p>

One strategy to combat this problem would be to reduce the salary of the employee who moved to the smaller city, but while this solves the inequity in pay, it can create backlash. Employees don’t like to see their pay cut; Google’s former head of HR <a href=\""https://fortune.com/2022/05/17/google-pay-cut-remote-workers-hr-chief-laszlo-bock-huge-mistake/\"" style=\""text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;\""><span style=\""color: #355bba; text-decoration: underline;\"">spoke out bluntly</span></a> about the company’s decision to reduce pay for people who relocate to lower cost of living areas, calling it a huge mistake.&nbsp;</span></p>"",""title"":""Location-Based Compensation""},{""animation"":{""animation_type"":""default""},""description"":""<p style=\""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;\""><span style=\""font-size: 20px;\"">A location-agnostic strategy involves paying employees based on their job title and qualifications regardless of where they live.

Your business could use any of these models - or even a combination - to determine compensation for remote workers. Rather than just jumping in and making a decision, it’s best to weigh your options.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.25;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Testing different models and evaluating how they would impact current employees and new hires is a critical step in finding the compensation strategy that will work best for your company and workforce. As is assessing how those models align with your company norms and culture. Being thorough on the front end will save a lot of time and avoid potential problems in the future.</span></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 24px;""><strong>Clear Communication is Key</strong></h3>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.25;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Regardless of which model you choose, ensuring transparency and clear communication is critical. Part of the backlash Google and other companies experienced when they moved to adjust pay based on employee-driven relocation was that it came as a surprise. When people are making decisions about where to live and work, they need to understand how that may (or may not) affect their compensation.</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.25;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Knowing how they will be compensated also allows potential recruits to make a better decision on how they fit within your company’s culture. Being open and transparent about your compensation model creates a culture of trust among your employees and can help with retention.&nbsp;</span></p>

"Bridging the Gap Between Data and Decisions","Bridging the Gap Between Data and Decisions","https://www.bettercomp.com/blog/bridging-the-gap-between-data-and-decisions","Compensation professionals work with a wide range of data, and reporting plays a crucial role in transforming those metrics into actionable intelligence.","2025-06-13 11:00:01","<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Compensation professionals work with a wide range of data — from market surveys and employee records to salaries and percentiles. Within the raw data lie key metrics and critical insights that can drive and shape organizational strategies and decision-making.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Reporting plays a crucial role in transforming those metrics into actionable intelligence. It connects the dots, enabling comp pros to evaluate programs, support strategic planning, and make confident, data-driven decisions.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">How Reporting Increases Transparency</h2>
<p>Between pay transparency laws, a hyper-competitive talent market, and ongoing job market shifts, comp pros face mounting pressure to make faster, smarter decisions — decisions that require both drilling into the details and zooming out for a broader perspective. <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Here are the most common areas where comp pros need to offer clarity and depth with other stakeholders:</span></p>
<h3>Fairness and Equity</h3>
<p>Ensuring fairness and equity is a top priority for compensation teams, and identifying salary gaps empowers organizations to address inequalities, boost morale, and drive retention. Compensation professionals often lean on reports that highlight salary gaps with factors like gender, location, or level to track internal equity and ensure pay differences are based on non-discriminatory factors like performance and experience, fostering fairness and consistency for employees performing similar roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Balancing a competitive market strategy with internal equity requires buy-in from leadership, but they can’t take the walk blindly. Finding ways to offer data and explanations for decisions helps clarify why and how choices are made.</p>
<h3>Competitive Status in the Market&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Competitive pay in a dynamic talent market is crucial to staying ahead. Compensation professionals often need to share data that helps companies identify where employees fall in comparison to market rates, fueling the decision-making that improves talent attraction, retention, and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Especially helpful for companies hiring across multiple markets, reporting on the market rates within their organization’s respective labor markets offers guidance for HR and talent-acquisition teams on what to offer in different areas.</p>
<h3>Program Health&nbsp;</h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px; color: #2f3139;"">As companies optimize and scale their comp programs, they need maintenance and calibration to remain on track with an organization’s goals, growth, and needs. Reports like a year-over-year analysis prove beneficial for ensuring programs keep pace with inflation, market trends, and adjusting to industry standards across all job families and geographies.The data tells the story of any compensation program, and reports offer a picture of trends that allow a closer look at the details of that story. </span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Bringing Your Data to Life, Your Way</h2>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/reporting%20image.png"" width=""416"" height=""316"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""reporting image"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 416px; float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 0px;"">While we’ve seen firsthand how often reports are used for sharing reasoning for compensation decisions, we understand that no two organizations are the same. To make the right decisions for your team, you need the right information to guide your choices.</p>
<p>Your data is unique, so you have to identify reports that share insights on the unique features of your organization’s compensation program. BetterComp empowers comp pros with a robust library of standard reports and report-building capabilities to deliver visualizations and insights tailored to your organization's specific needs (and, at no additional cost).</p>
<p>We continue to expand on the ways you can transform raw data into actionable insights — quickly, efficiently, and with unparalleled flexibility.</p>

"Why You Need to Invest in Compensation Today","Why You Need to Invest in Compensation Today","https://www.bettercomp.com/blog/why-you-need-to-invest-in-comp-today","For small and mid-sized organizations, the idea of investing in compensation might not feel urgent—until it is. ","2025-05-27 08:45:02","<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Getting pay right isn’t just a nice-to-have, it’s a necessity. For small and mid-sized organizations, the idea of investing in a formalized compensation program may feel like something to put off until you’re “big enough.”&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Compensation might not feel urgent—until it is. Maybe you’re handling pay decisions on a case-by-case basis or maybe salary ranges live in a spreadsheet. Maybe your managers are struggling to answer candidate questions about salary expectations, or maybe employees are starting to talk about fairness.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">The truth is, compensation isn’t just a back-office function. It’s one of the most visible and impactful ways your business shows what it values, and now is the time to invest in what matters most.<br><br></p>
<!--more-->
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Compensation is a Strategic Lever, Not Just an Operational Task</h2>
<p>When executed well, compensation can help you attract and retain the right people, support high performance, and build a culture of fairness and trust. But when it's an afterthought, it becomes a liability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many small and midsized businesses invest in their employer brand, culture, and talent development—but without a compensation framework to support those efforts, they're building on shaky ground.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your compensation strategy is the foundation that gives structure and consistency to how you value work and reward employees. Without a solid foundation, hiring decisions get messy, internal equity issues crop up, and managers are left to negotiate in the dark.<br> By treating compensation as a strategic priority, you give your business a real advantage—especially in today’s competitive talent market.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Fair, Transparent Pay Builds Employee Trust and Engagement!</h2>
<p>Employees talk. Candidates compare notes. And <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/pay-transparency-is-growing-heres-what-you-need-to-know"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">pay transparency</a></span> — whether you're ready or not — is becoming more common every year. While full salary transparency isn’t required for every organization, consistency and fairness are. When employees understand how pay decisions are made, they're more likely to trust leadership and stay engaged.</p>
<p>Investing in compensation doesn't just mean throwing more money at people. It means building clear salary ranges, aligning pay to roles and levels, and having a point of view on how your organization wants to compete in the market. Are you a <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/compensation-market-strategy-your-competitive-advantage-beyond-lead-lag-match"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">market leader, matcher, or follower</a></span>? Do you reward potential or experience? These decisions matter—and they signal what you truly value. A fair and structured approach also helps ensure compliance with new and emerging pay equity laws, which are only gaining momentum.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Compensation Supports Talent Goals: From Hiring to Retention</h2>
<p>It’s hard to win in the talent market if you don’t know where you stand. For growing companies, especially those expanding into new roles or geographies, market-based compensation data and clearly defined salary ranges are essential. When you invest in compensation, your team can make faster, more confident offers, reduce back-and-forth negotiation, and avoid the risk of lowballing candidates or overpaying just to get someone in the door. </p>
<p>On the retention side, having a compensation framework helps you spot gaps, reward your best people, and plan for growth. It gives you a foundation for performance-based rewards, promotions, and career development so your employees’ pay matches your <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/compensation-can-make-or-break-employer-brand"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">employer&nbsp;brand</a></span>.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">A Compensation Framework Makes Your Managers Better Leaders</h2>
<p>One of the most overlooked benefits of investing in compensation is the clarity and support it gives your managers. When a compensation strategy isn’t clearly defined or communicated, managers are asked to navigate salary conversations with no guidance, no ranges, and no data. These unclear conversations aren’t just frustrating—they’re risky.</p>
<p>With a thoughtful compensation structure, managers are empowered to talk about pay with confidence. They can answer questions from candidates and team members, advocate for fair and consistent pay decisions, and focus on developing their teams instead of managing exceptions. Your managers are some of your most important communicators. Equip them with the right tools, and they’ll help reinforce your values, build trust, and reduce confusion around compensation.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Creating Your Compensation Framework</h2>
<p>If you’re just starting out, the idea of building a compensation strategy might sound overwhelming. But you don’t need to launch a full compensation overhaul overnight. Start small with one of the following steps we recommend for creating a <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/building-a-high-growth-comp-framework"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">compensation framework</a></span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define your compensation philosophy.</li>
<li>Identify a few key roles and benchmark them using <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/bettercomp-prime-market-data-bridging-the-gap-for-small-mid-sized-teams"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">modern market data</a></span>.</li>
<li>Build salary ranges that give structure to your hiring efforts.</li>
<li>Create a consistent offer process.</li>
<li>Educate your managers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even incremental progress can have a major impact — on your team, your hiring success, and your ability to scale sustainably.</p>
<p>Compensation isn’t just about numbers. It’s about values, strategy, and business outcomes. For growing organizations who are looking to compete in the job market and retain quality talent, getting compensation right is essential. Investing in compensation today sets the foundation for a more fair, transparent, and effective workplace as you continue to grow.&nbsp;</p>

"Why Spreadsheets Don't Cut It For Compensation Management","Why Spreadsheets Don't Cut It For Compensation Management","https://www.bettercomp.com/blog/why-spreadsheets-dont-cut-it-for-comp","Spreadsheets are helpful, but as your team grows, they may not fit your compensation needs. Explore 5 reasons why spreadsheets don't cut it for comp!","2025-05-19 12:15:01","<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Where would you rather keep your most valuable investments? In a duct-taped box or in a secure vault? When you’re working with important information, you want it easily accessible, but you wouldn’t want it scattered in different places or held together by paperclips.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Your organization’s most important investment — your people — shouldn’t be managed with a quickly-created, fallible system either… and spreadsheets aren’t strong enough for dealing with such a crucial part of company success.&nbsp;<br>Spreadsheets are flexible, familiar, and cheap, so most growing teams have used spreadsheets to track <em>everything</em> as they’re getting started. Tasks like PTO, budgets, and to-do lists are the perfect fit for spreadsheets. For a while, spreadsheets can work for compensation, too, especially when your team is small and your org chart is simple.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">But eventually, they break.  </p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">While your company grows with more people, more roles, more managers, and more locations, spreadsheets start to show their cracks. They become slow, error-prone, and nearly impossible to scale. The bigger the stakes, the riskier it gets. And when it comes to compensation, the stakes are high. If you're still relying on spreadsheets to manage pay, here’s why it might be time to consider how to level up your spreadsheets by shifting to a dedicated compensation platform (like BetterComp!).</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">As you weigh your options, I’ve gathered 5 Reasons Why Spreadsheets Don’t Cut It for Compensation Management.<br><br></p>
<!--more-->
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">1. Spreadsheets Can Lead to Errors (And the Consequences Are Costly)</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the basics: spreadsheets are fragile. It only takes one copied formula, one bad paste, or one missed row to create a mistake — and the bigger the spreadsheet, the harder it is to spot. With <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://slashdot.org/story/24/08/13/2335207/study-finds-94-of-business-spreadsheets-have-critical-errors"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">94% of business spreadsheets containing critical errors</a></span>, mistakes are fine if you’re tracking lunch orders, but they aren’t fine when you're managing employee pay.<br>An incorrect salary range, miscalculated bonus, or outdated benchmark can lead to a major misstep for employee pay and could impact the longevity of your overall compensation strategy. Market pricing platforms can help your team: </p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid underpaying or overpaying employees</li>
<li>Limit equity issues and internal frustration</li>
<li>Lower offer rejections or re-negotiations around compensation</li>
<li>Decrease compliance risks, especially around <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/pay-transparency-is-growing-heres-what-you-need-to-know"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">pay equity and transparency laws</a></span>  </li>
</ul>
<p>The truth is, it’s hard to trust a system you’ve outgrown. And when your people are relying on you to get pay right, trust matters.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">2. Spreadsheets Take Time — Lots of It!</h2>
<p>If your team is scaling, your compensation tool needs to scale too. Even the most simple updates like refreshing benchmarks, adjusting salary ranges, or pulling compensation summaries for a manager can take hours when working with a spreadsheet. And as headcount grows, so does the time burden.<br><br>HR and comp teams in mid-market companies often spend significant amounts of their time cleaning and formatting data, building version-controlled models for different departments, and fielding questions from recruiters and managers. The time spent on these tasks could be invested on more strategic work like refining your pay philosophy, improving internal equity, or enabling managers to have better conversations about compensation. A dedicated compensation platform automates the manual parts, so your team can focus on the big picture.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">3. Spreadsheets Make Collaboration Hard</h2>
<p>Compensation isn’t just an HR concern, it’s a team sport! Recruiters need to know where to start offers. Managers need to see what’s fair for their team. Finance needs data to budget and forecast. Leadership wants visibility. With spreadsheets, collaboration gets clunky fast. You’re emailing versions back and forth, chasing down last-minute edits, or dealing with conflicting information, and when you finally “lock the spreadsheet,” someone still has a copy they’re referencing anyway. With a clean, all-in-one compensation platform like BetterComp, everyone works from the same source of truth. You can set roles, permissions, and workflows that make collaboration secure <em>and</em> simple.<span style=""font-size: 12px; color: #2f3139;""></span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">4. Spreadsheets Can’t Handle Complexity</h2>
<p>Today’s compensation programs are more dynamic than ever. Growing teams see an emergence of multiple job levels and families, geographic differentials, promotion and adjustment policies, and equity considerations. As more compensation complexities arise,<br>spreadsheets struggle to keep up. The information becomes overwhelming and every exception adds another layer of risk. Compensation platforms are purpose-built to handle complexity without creating chaos. You can price jobs, build salary ranges, apply geographic adjustments, and maintain internal consistency, all without needing to debug cell B47.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">5. Spreadsheets Don’t Help You Tell the Story</h2>
<p>Even when you have all the numbers, it can be difficult to explain the <em>why</em>&nbsp;behind your compensation strategy. Compensation platforms help you share rationale behind salary ranges, show how market benchmarks were selected, and visualize equity and pay band distribution without flipping through spreadsheet tabs. Consistent, clear data with visibility into your decision-making builds trust within your HR team, across leadership, and with employees.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">How Market Pricing Software Changes the Game</h2>
<p>BetterComp was built for compensation teams who’ve outgrown spreadsheets. It gives you the tools to manage compensation without spending hours wrangling data. With BetterComp’s dynamic market pricing software, you can use modern market data to price jobs quickly and accurately and reduce manual work by eliminating errors and collaborating in one system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You don’t need a 10-person comp team to get started. BetterComp is designed for lean HR and People teams who need to do more with less—and want to build a foundation that supports growth.</p>
</blockquote>
<div>Spreadsheets were never meant to be compensation systems. They’re a short-term solution to a long-term challenge.  If your organization is growing, your compensation strategy needs to grow with it. It’s time to stop patching holes and start building something that lasts. With BetterComp, you can move faster, reduce risk, and give your people the confidence that pay decisions are fair, data-driven, and right.</div>

"Transitioning From Jobs to a Job Architecture","Transitioning From Jobs to a Job Architecture","https://www.bettercomp.com/blog/jobs-to-job-architecture","When do you need a formal job architecture? And how do you create one that will work for your organization? BetterComp's Chief Customer Officer has answers.","2025-05-15 09:19:21","<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">When most people think of job architecture, specifically levels, what they’re really thinking about is job titles<span style=""background-color: transparent;"">. </span><span style=""background-color: transparent;"">Job titles help clarify what a job involves and how it functions within a company. Assigning the right job the correct title can make all the difference when it comes to finding quality candidates and compensating them accordingly. But, when compensation professionals are pricing jobs at scale, the job title alone is just a starting point.</span></span></p>
<!--more-->
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Early on, companies can easily get away with just having jobs - after all, there’s only one customer success team, one software development team, one HR team, etc., each staffed by just a few people. However, as companies grow—adding business units, acquiring other companies, and expanding into new markets—jobs alone aren’t sufficient. HR and comp teams need a formal job architecture.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">What is a Job Architecture?</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/crane-with-blocks-building-job-architecture.jpg"" alt=""crane-with-blocks-building-job-architecture"" width=""207"" loading=""lazy"" style=""width: 207px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">A job architecture, alternatively known as a job structure or leveling convention, is a formal map of the infrastructure of jobs in your organization. People often hear this and think of a reporting structure or org chart, but that’s actually too granular. Instead, this is a structure that can be applied across teams, divisions, and geographies. It provides clear competency requirements for job titles, supports career development and internal mobility, and helps determine the value of jobs to your organization.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 28px;"">Job Architecture Components: Families, Levels, Etcetera</h3>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">A job architecture consists of both job families and functions and a leveling convention. Having a clear understanding of each is vital to building an effective job structure.</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Job families are high level groupings that capture broadly the functional area of a set of jobs. For example software engineering or HR. Functions are sometimes known as sub-families and create more definition between sets of jobs. Thinking about the software engineering family, some of the functions contained in that grouping could be front-end development, back-end development, and quality assurance.</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Job levels provide clarity on the differences in responsibility, skills, and knowledge required. They also create a career progression framework that organizations can use to develop employee career pathing programs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Why Create a Job Architecture?</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Having a formal job architecture in place is valuable for more than just comp professionals. HR teams, people managers, and employees all benefit from the clarity that this structure provides.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">One of the core benefits across the organization is ease of communication. A <a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/report-finds-nearly-two-thirds-of-employees-seek-increased-transparency-around-compensation-301571497.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">recent survey by Lattice</span></a> found that 67% of employees want more transparency in compensation decisions. Creating a framework for compensation relative to job level and family makes that type of transparency much easier. Being able to communicate how compensation lines up with competencies and provide employees with a clear picture of how they can move within the organization and grow their career can also increase engagement and reduce turnover.</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">For comp professionals, a job architecture is more than this. It's a valuable tool they use every day to price jobs.</span></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 28px;"">Job Architecture and Market Pricing</h3>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">A well-defined job architecture, complete with job titles, descriptions, and levels, makes market pricing significantly easier. It allows comp teams to more easily map the internal framework to external market data. It also creates consistency across business units, geographies, and other internal divisions, streamlining the market pricing process and significantly improving accuracy and responsiveness.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">When to Implement a Job Architecture</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Not every company needs a formal job architecture. Here at BetterComp, we have a small team with just a few people in each job family. Creating and documenting a job architecture for our company at this stage would be premature. However, for a large, multinational organization lacking a job architecture is a recipe for disaster.</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Most organizations fall somewhere between startup and a spot on the Fortune 500. Understanding when the best time to formalize a job architecture for them is a bit art and a bit science. Deloitte’s job architecture guide, <a href=""https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/human-capital/us-cons-job-architecture-041315.pdf"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">Laying the Building Blocks for Effective Human Capital Management</span></a>, calls out a few triggers that indicate starting a job architecture project is worthwhile:</span><span style=""font-size: 20px;""></span></p>
<ul style=""font-size: 18px;"">
<li aria-level=""1""><span style=""color: #2f3139; font-size: 20px;"">Implementation of HR or compensation technology</span></li>
<li aria-level=""1""><span style=""color: #2f3139; font-size: 20px;"">Substantial changes to organizational structure, including spinning off new business units, new acquisitions or mergers, and expansion into global markets</span></li>
<li aria-level=""1""><span style=""color: #2f3139; font-size: 20px;"">Redesign of compensation programs</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">While any of these are signs that it’s time to build or formalize your job architecture, experience tells me that earlier is always better. Having something basic in place early on in the organization - even if it’s just aligned with titles or is specific to individual families - sets the foundation for more structured, complex architectures later on.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Developing Your Job Architecture</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Once you’ve determined the need to formalize your job architecture, it’s time to get started. Your first step is aligning with stakeholders from across the organization - not just HR and comp. Getting executive leadership, subject matter experts, and other business leaders on board with the project is critical to success.</span></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 28px;"">Steps to Building Your Job Architecture</h3>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Creating a job architecture is less about building from scratch and more about bringing structure and alignment to something that already exists. There are 4 key steps to creating your job architecture:</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #e65c19;""><strong>1. Gather Information</strong></span></h3>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">The first step is always to understand where things stand currently. Gather information on all your jobs including departments, titles, descriptions, competencies, and current pay. You may find that some employees are handling oversized loads, or you may identify overlapping responsibilities. That’s a natural part of investigating your business’s structure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #e65c19;""><strong>2. Align Job Titles, Competencies, and Levels</strong></span></h3>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Once you have the full picture of your existing jobs, you can begin to evaluate the hierarchies that appear in each family. You’ll create your leveling convention by deciding on the right number of levels for each family and defining your leveling criteria. If you’ve been market pricing at the job level, your market survey data may have leveling conventions included that you can use for guidance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">The most important thing here is that your levels make sense and align with both the value each job creates for your organization and <span style=""background-color: transparent;"">with your company values. Once you have your levels and competencies set, work with subject matter experts and HR to revise job descriptions and titles to match your new leveling convention.</span></span></p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;""><span style=""background-color: transparent; color: #e65c19; font-size: 20px;"">3. Align Compensation Practices</span></h3>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Align your levels with your preferred market data providers if you haven’t already done so. From here, you will be able to build your global pay structures relative to both market pricing and company requirements. Test and evaluate your work to ensure it will have the impact you want and to find potential flaws or unintended consequences.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #e65c19;""><strong>4. Implement and Communicate</strong></span></h3>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Once you have your framework created and it passes muster with your SMEs and business leaders, it’s time to implement. This involves things like setting up your leveling convention in your comp software, communicating with recruitment and hiring managers, adding appropriate information to your HRIS systems, and communicating with your staff.</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">If this all sounds like a lot of work, that’s because it is. If your internal resources aren’t sufficient to the task, consider hiring an outside consultant to help. Companies like <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.culpepper.com/Consulting/"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;"">Culpepper</a></span>, <a href=""https://www.kornferry.com/content/kornferry/en/solutions/organizational-strategy/strategic-workforce-planning.html"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">Korn Ferry</span></a>, <a href=""https://rewards.aon.com/en-us/solutions/advice/employee-rewards"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #3473f2;"">Aon</span></a>, and <a href=""https://www.wtwco.com/en-US/Solutions/services/job-architecture-job-leveling-and-reward-and-career-frameworks"" style=""text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">WTW</span></a> provide consultation services alongside market data surveys. Not only will they have experience creating job architectures for their clients, they’ll bring fresh eyes and perspective to your project. Technology can help, as well. <a href=""https://www.mercer.ch/our-thinking/mercer-job-architecture-tool.html"">Mercer</a>, for example, offers a tool that can help you build and maintain your job architecture.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Implementing Job Levels with Your HR and Comp Technology</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">One of the most important things you will do is ensure that your job architecture is accurately reflected in your compensation and HRIS systems.

"How Compensation Can Make or Break Your Employer Brand","How Compensation Can Make or Break Your Employer Brand","https://www.bettercomp.com/blog/compensation-can-make-or-break-employer-brand","The right comp philosophy can either enhance or detract from your employer brand. Learn how to help build a strong employer brand through compensation.","2025-05-15 09:12:15","<p>The automatic response when people think of “brand” is to look to marketing, not HR. But, in today’s competitive labor market, a strong employer brand is an invaluable asset to attracting and retaining top talent. And your compensation strategy is a key component.</p> 
<!--more--><h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;"">What is an Employer Brand?</span></h2> 
<p>Just as your corporate brand encompasses your reputation in the marketplace,&nbsp; your employer brand refers to your company’s reputation and image as an employer. Most importantly for this discussion, it encompasses your employee value proposition (EVP). Like your customer value proposition, your EVP consists of the unique benefits and rewards your organization offers to its employees in exchange for their skills and contributions.</p> 
<p>A strong employer brand can be a powerful tool for attracting and retaining top talent. When potential employees perceive a company as a great place to work, they are more likely to apply for positions and be motivated to join the team. A strong employer brand can also help to reduce employee turnover and improve engagement, producing better business outcomes.</p> 
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Elements of an Employer Brand</span></h3> 
<p>Brands are sprawling, complex things with a million moving parts. That said, your employer brand has some core components to keep in mind.</p> 
<h4 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;"">1. Culture &amp; Values</span></h4> 
<p>Your company's culture and values are the foundation <img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Stock%20Photography/employees-culture.jpg"" alt=""employees-culture"" width=""379"" height=""314"" loading=""lazy"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 379px; float: right; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;"">of your employer brand. Employees are increasingly seeking organizations that align with their personal values and provide an inclusive, supportive, and engaging workplace. But <em>saying</em> what your values and culture are isn’t sufficient - these things need to be evident in every business decision and interaction, both with employees and with customers. Stated values that aren’t clearly practiced breathe inauthenticity into both your customer and employer brand. And people can smell that miles off.</p> 
<h4 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;"">2. Employee experience</span></h4> 
<p>Employee experience plays a pivotal role in shaping the overall employer brand of an organization. It encompasses all the interactions, perceptions, and emotions an employee goes through during their tenure with a company. A positive employee experience fosters a sense of belonging, purpose, and satisfaction within the workforce. When employees feel supported, valued, and empowered, they become advocates for the company's products or services, attracting top talent and boosting the employer brand reputation.</p> 
<h4 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;"">3. Candidate experience</span></h4> 
<p>Similar to employee experience, candidate experience is the sum of all interactions a candidate has with your organization during the hiring process. Think of this as the journey that potential employees take when they interact with your brand. From the moment they discover your company to the final stages of the hiring process, it's crucial to create a smooth and positive experience. Sites like <a href=""https://www.glassdoor.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Glassdoor</a> not only review employee experience, but also how the hiring process is for candidates. Be responsive, respectful, and make sure they feel like they're valued from the jump.<img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Stock%20Photography/star-rating.jpg"" alt=""star-rating"" width=""606"" height=""260"" loading=""lazy"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 606px; margin: 10px auto; display: block;""></p> 
<h4 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;"">4. Employee Value Proposition</span></h4> 
<p>Your EVP the value employees receive by working with you. It includes things like name recognition (we’ve all seen the “former COMPANY NAME” info in LinkedIn headlines), career advancement and growth opportunities, perks, benefits, and of course, compensation. Your EVP should align with the type of people who will be successful at your company and who will, in turn, help your company achieve success.&nbsp;</p> 
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;"">Employer Brand &amp; Compensation Strategy</span></h2> 
<p>Compensation is often the primary factor considered by individuals when evaluating employment opportunities, but it’s also frequently overlooked when considering employer brand. That’s a mistake.</p> 
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Importance of Compensation for Hiring and Retention</span></h3> 
<p>While rumblings of impending recession have been going on for some time and news of mass layoffs seems to hit LinkedIn every other day, the talent market remains highly competitive. The combination of a strong employer brand paired with effective compensation strategy can be a major competitive advantage for recruitment. The rise in <a href=""/blog/effective-market-pricing-important-pay-transparency"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">pay transparency laws</a> that mandate upfront disclosure of salary range for posted positions make compensation an even larger part of a company’s EVP.&nbsp;</p> 
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Stock%20Photography/happy-employee-laptop.jpg"" alt=""happy-employee-laptop"" width=""404"" height=""211"" loading=""lazy"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 404px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;"">Getting compensation right is also critical for employee retention. Those same pay transparency laws that require employers to list salary ranges in job postings are uncovering challenges around pay compression for existing employees. The <a href=""https://www.entrepreneur.com/business-news/woman-applies-to-her-same-job-offering-much-higher-salary/447471"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>story of the UX writer</span></a> who, after seeing her position listed for significantly more than her current salary, applied for her own job springs to mind. That may be an unusual case, but ensuring that your current employees are paid fairly relative to the market can go a long way toward keeping them happy with your company.&nbsp;</p> 
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Aligning Compensation Strategy and Employer Brand</span></h3> 
<p>While some would argue that a strong employer brand allows companies to lower their total compensation and vise-versa, I’d argue that having a compensation strategy that supports your HR goals is a core component to a strong employer brand. Company culture doesn’t pay the rent. That’s why ensuring compensation and employer brand are in lock step matters so much: compensation is a tangible reflection of your EVP.</p> 
<h4 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;"">Define Your Compensation Philosophy</span></h4> 
<p>Starting off, you will need to define your compensation philosophy. This is part of an overall total rewards philosophy, which includes perks and benefits. Your compensation philosophy takes your mission, core values, and company goals and uses that information to define the principles you use to make compensation decisions. You will need to be able to clearly communicate this philosophy to all stakeholders - including leadership, HR, employees, and potentially your board of directors. Once you have an idea of what your compensation philosophy should look like, run it past a couple of trusted people within your team and wider organization to make sure everything feels aligned with your employer brand and desired EVP.</p> 
<h4 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;"">Assess Your Current State</span></h4> 
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Stock%20Photography/Employee-review.jpg"" alt=""Employee-review"" width=""262"" height=""276"" loading=""lazy"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 262px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;"">Next analyze how your current compensation and benefits programs compare to the market standards and expectations, as well as how the reality on the ground compares to your defined compensation philosophy. You’ll use that comparison to build out a compensation structure that effectively supports your employer brand and EVP. There are a number of tools and methods you can use, including surveys, focus groups, benchmarking, audits, and gap analysis.</p> 
<h4 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;"">Monitor and Update</span></h4> 
<p>Finally, remember that your employer brand, EVP, and compensation philosophy are living things that need to grow and adapt to changing circumstances. Set up systems to monitor your employer brand and compensation structure performance. Many of the tools you used in your initial evaluation will be helpful going forward - particularly as you’ll be able to compare results over time.</p>

"A Modern Approach: Pairing Compensation Surveys with Real-Time Data","A Modern Approach: Pairing Compensation Surveys with Real-Time Data","https://www.bettercomp.com/blog/a-modern-approach-pairing-compensation-surveys-with-real-time-data","Modern compensation calls for the use of multiple data sources. Learn more about how and when to supplement with real-time data.","2025-05-15 09:11:38","<p>The world of compensation is complex and influenced by a variety of factors such as company size, location, industry, and philosophy. One thing that unites compensation professionals across the board is the critical role of data in making compensation decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For many years, traditional survey data has been seen as the gold standard. While this remains true, technological advancements and volatile market conditions have increased demand for real-time data as a supplementary source. Getting compensation right is critical, and in order to have an effective data strategy, compensation leaders need answers to questions like:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">How reliable is real-time data?</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">What data sources should they use in conjunction with their surveys?</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">When should they deploy different data sets?&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">And, how do they effectively pair survey data with alternative data sources?&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">The Role of Data in Compensation</span></strong></span><span style=""font-size: 11px; color: #000000;""><br></span>Taking a “shot in the dark” is not an option for compensation professionals, whose actions have real, visible impacts on both the employer and the employees. On one hand, there is a need to meet stakeholder expectations by aligning compensation strategies to organizational goals and budget. On the other hand, there is a need to serve as champions for employees and foster an environment where people feel fairly compensated, valued, and motivated. Striking this delicate balance requires a level of precision that can only be achieved through reliable sources of data.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;"">Traditional Survey Data</h3>
<p>Traditional compensation surveys are a highly credible source of data and widely considered to be the gold standard. During survey participation season, thousands of companies around the world share details of employee compensation and total rewards with third-party survey vendors. These survey vendors then follow a rigorous methodology to analyze and validate the data. The meticulous nature of these surveys paired with high-volume, comprehensive data sets give users confidence in the accuracy and reliability of the results.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;"">Real-Time Data</h3>
<p>Recently, the compensation landscape has also started to see the rise of real-time data. Crowdsourced data is a commonly known type of real-time data in which an employee self-reports their compensation and rewards information to public platforms like <a href=""https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/index.htm"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>Glassdoor</span></a><span style=""color: #1155cc;"">.</span> Recently, Compa released <a href=""https://www.trycompa.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>Compa Index</span></a>, which “collects compensation data using offers from applicant tracking systems”<span style=""color: #1155cc;""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">.</span> </span>This has piqued the interest in offer-based data as another viable form of real-time data. Real-time data is relatively newer and often less regulated than traditional compensation surveys, but more and more compensation leaders are starting to see a place for it.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">The Value of Supplementing&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p>While traditional compensation surveys remain fundamental in the space, compensation professionals are increasingly turning to real-time data as an alternative source, especially during times of market volatility. Given that traditional survey results are typically released yearly or at regular intervals throughout the year, they may not always feel reflective of the current state of the labor market.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During times when the market shifts faster than expected, compensation teams may be faced with pressing organizational needs—such as a sudden increase in demand for a particular role or changes to an organization’s financial standing. In these moments, real-time data can provide a pulse on current market conditions, as well as arm compensation teams with another layer of credibility they need to implement, justify, and communicate their pay strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Data-Variety.svg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Data-Variety"" width=""281"" height=""280"" style=""width: 281px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; float: left; margin: 10px 25px 10px 0px;"">Supplementing with real-time data may also help compensation teams take a proactive approach in their talent strategy. In today’s day and age, employees also have several resources at their fingertips that provide insights into how much people are getting paid for a particular role. Sources may include third-party forums, conversations with other recruiters, and pay ranges listed on other job postings. These sources will not have the same level of accuracy that traditional surveys do, but they nonetheless empower employees to step into salary conversations with more knowledge. By supplementing with real-time data, compensation teams can stay more up-to-date on the latest market trends and gain a competitive edge when it comes to attracting and retaining top talent.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Integrating Multiple Data Sources into Workflow</span></strong></h2>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Data-Collect.svg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Data-Collect"" width=""244"" height=""239"" style=""width: 244px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; float: right; margin: 10px 7px 10px 30px;"">Using different data sources helps compensation professionals gain a more comprehensive understanding of market conditions impacting their pay strategies. A critical part of understanding how to weave these data sources together is to recognize that they have different use cases. Charlie Franklin, CEO of Compa, explains this using the <a href=""https://www.trycompa.com/post/what-is-market-competitive-compensation-with-instacarts-jessica-cheng"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>analogy of an energy grid</span></a>; Charlie compares an energy grid’s base load to traditional survey data because it offers stability and thus is great for “foundational, high-volume, and stable pay strategy” while real-time data is better equipped to handle “volatility or peak demand.” Additionally, given the unique capabilities of each data source, it may not be necessary to supplement with real-time data for <em>all </em>your jobs. Instead, it is arguably more efficient and beneficial to focus on supplementing your “core” jobs (such as a software engineer for a tech company or a financial analyst for an investment firm), since these are areas where you need to be the most competitive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditional survey data and real-time data each offer its own unique value. Having both tools in the toolbox and knowing how and when to weave them together gives compensation teams a fresh perspective and a competitive edge needed to keep up in this ever-changing market. Having a comprehensive data set also provides greater confidence and credibility when building your case or justifying and communicating decisions to both stakeholders and employees.<span style=""color: #000000;""> &nbsp;</span></p>

Even just five years ago, organizations relied almost exclusively on traditional surveys for concrete data. Since then, technological advancements and shifts in both the regulatory landscape and workplace culture have generated a wave of alternative compensation data sources. As a result, comp pros are increasingly looking to supplement their existing data strategy to gain a more comprehensive perspective.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>“Alternative data” is a blanket term used to describe any data source that falls outside of traditional compensation surveys. The swell of available alternative data sources is creating a lot of buzz across the compensation industry. These non-traditional data sources opened up a new world of possibilities for comp pros. However, there are still significant questions <em>(and concerns)</em> about how these sources compare to established methods and how to best integrate them into existing frameworks.</p>

<p>Here are some of the key highlights from this discussion:&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;""><strong>There is no such thing as a “perfect” data set</strong></span></h2>
<p>During the webinar, our panelists assessed traditional surveys and four alternative data sources—offers, job posting, aggregated, and crowdsourced—across key market pricing dimensions. These dimensions included volume + density, specificity, recency, and defensibility, and are defined in Table 1 below.</p>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Table%201.%20Defining%20Market%20Pricing%20Dimensions%20%20(1).png"" width=""2400"" height=""1600"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Table 1. Defining Market Pricing Dimensions  (1)"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 2400px;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Table 1. Defining Market Pricing Dimensions</p>
<p><em>*Volume and Density are different but related concepts. You can’t have density without volume, but it is possible to have volume without density. For the purpose of this webinar, we grouped together these two concepts to highlight their complementary nature. “Volume” is purposefully listed first to emphasize the importance of having good volume as the foundation for meaningful density.</em></p>
<p>Every type of data available has its strengths and weaknesses. Creating and optimizing a data strategy is about balancing those against organizational needs. For example, while traditional surveys excel in volume (and typically density), specificity, and defensibility, they tend to fall short on recency. On the other hand, offers data is very recent but lacks comparatively in volume and density.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternative data sources — even within the same category— can vary widely in how they rank across the market pricing dimensions. Just like with surveys, every individual provider has their own unique methodology that affects the final output. Because there is so much variability in the methods used to collect, validate, and process the information, it’s crucial to work with data providers who are transparent about their processes and methodology, so you can fully understand the strengths and limitations of the data you're using.</p>

<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;""><strong>Alternative data sources offer a unique lens to analyze competitive pay</strong></span></h2>
<p>Our panelists emphasized that while alternative data sources are not a replacement for traditional compensation surveys today, they provide an additional perspective for analyzing competitive pay. Drawing from their real-world experiences, our panelists shared insights into the strengths, weaknesses, and specific use cases of each alternative data source.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><strong>Offers Data:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Matt described offers data, which he gets from our friends at <a href=""https://www.trycompa.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>Compa,</span></a> as “one of the most immediate and actionable sources of compensation information available,” often reflecting pay trends within a 1-3 month window. Offers data provides a snapshot of what companies are currently willing to pay for specific roles and locations, while also shedding light on candidate reactions through accepted and declined rates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Matt explained that the recency of offers data allows his team to adjust quickly and stay competitive. Having insight into a range of offers (high to low) and seeing how candidates respond to those offers also provides valuable information that helps prevent overpayment. Matt finds offers data especially useful when they are hiring rapidly, when the market is fluctuating due to external factors like the economy, and when a new talent competitor moves into the market.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><strong>Job Posting Data:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Mark provided valuable insights into how job posting data can be a practical tool for compensation analysis, especially when published surveys haven’t caught up with new or rapidly evolving roles. He explained how it can help validate pay levels for emerging positions, address manager concerns about hiring within budget, and even refine company job descriptions by benchmarking against other organizations. Mark noted that job posting is also a great tool for those wanting to view trends more specifically since it allows you to drill down to specific months and/or geography.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Mark stressed the importance of approaching job posting data with caution due to potential biases and inconsistencies. This includes variations in job titles, the lack of data for low-turnover roles, and differences in how salary information is reported across companies, locations and industries (eg. base pay vs. variable pay).&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><strong>Aggregated Data:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Aggregated data gathers different compensation information from various sources and uses mathematical analysis to provide a more consolidated view. Towards the end of the pandemic, retail chains faced a tight labor market and needed more regional and local data than national surveys could provide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jordan and his team at Meijer—a supermarket chain with 248 locations across six states— were in need of more localized insights to validate their data strategy. They chose not to use job posting data for this purpose because most states they operate in don't mandate pay transparency, resulting in highly inconsistent job posting information. Instead, Jordan’s team landed on an aggregation tool that allowed them to drill down to certain zip codes for specific jobs. Having access to these local data points was critical for gaining leadership buy-in for their compensation strategy. The consolidated nature of aggregated data makes it great for getting extensive coverage. However, Jordan noted that it is challenging to assess the recency and specificity because you often have no insight into the specific data points being used in the calculation.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><strong>Crowdsourced Data:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Alan clarified the role of crowdsourced data, which typically comes as employee reported information on public forums like Glassdoor. Since most crowdsourced data is not validated or verified, it's very difficult to be confident about its quality and accuracy. While crowdsourced data is very cost-effective and can offer insights into what employees are seeing, it is not ideal as a primary benchmarking tool because it often greatly lacks defensibility. <a href=""https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Zappos.com,Skillz,Amazon&amp;track=Software%20Engineer"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>Levels.fyi</span></a> stands out as one of the few crowdsourced data providers that validates the information, adding a layer of credibility.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;""><strong>Best practices for leveraging alternative data&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
<p>Our panelists also shared best practices to help integrate alternative data effectively. Here are some of the major insights:&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 24px;""><strong>1. Align Data Sources with Business Needs</strong></span></h4>
<p>Jordan emphasized the importance of ""really understanding that business need that some of these data sources would fulfill."" As shown by the real-world examples above, different alternative data sources serve different use cases. Therefore, identifying the problem you're trying to solve is a critical step in aligning the right data with your specific business needs and maximizing its value.</p>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 24px;""><strong>2. Strengthen and Understand Job Architecture</strong></span></h4>
<p>Mark stressed the role of job architecture in leveraging alternative data sources, noting that ""the energy that you put into your company's job architecture will greatly enhance your ability to incorporate alternative data sources into your competitive pay analytics."" He advised spending ample time understanding your job roles and how they relate to each other.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><span style=""font-size: 24px;""><strong>3. Assess Data Relevance and Methodologies</strong></span></h4>
<p>Matt highlighted the importance of evaluating data relevance, noting ""There is data literally everywhere now…But it's not all relevant to use."" When choosing a data set, Matt encourages comp pros to consider “Does it have the right set of companies? Does it have the right pay elements?” He also emphasized the importance of understanding the methodology behind the data and working with data providers that can ensure the data is well-cleaned, validated, and applicable to your organization.&nbsp;</p>

"Building a Compensation Framework for High-Growth Companies","Building a Compensation Framework for High-Growth Companies","https://www.bettercomp.com/blog/building-a-high-growth-comp-framework","If your team is growing and hiring quickly, your compensation plan is probably changing too! It's time to build a framework that grows with you.","2025-05-14 10:45:01","<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">For companies in growth mode, things move fast. Headcount doubles. Teams expand across new functions and geographies. Titles evolve—or disappear altogether. Amid all the momentum, compensation decisions are often made on the fly,<br>but that approach doesn’t last. Without a compensation framework, every hiring or pay decision becomes a one-off. You risk creating internal inequity, overpaying or underpaying new hires, or worse, your team may start to lose trust in how pay works at your company.  A thoughtful compensation framework gives your company structure and consistency, helping you make smarter, fairer decisions as you grow. It helps you attract talent, retain your best people, and support managers in having confident conversations about pay. </p>
<!--more-->
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Why High-Growth Companies Need a Framework</h2>
<p>When your company is small, it’s tempting to treat compensation as flexible. You match offers to market conditions, negotiate based on each candidate, and keep ranges (if they exist) in someone’s head or a spreadsheet.<br> This works for a while, but growth brings complexity. You’re hiring more people, faster. You’re layering in management. You’re planning budgets and headcount more seriously. Suddenly, ad hoc pay decisions create problems. Common challenges a compensation framework alleviate are:</p>
<ul>
<li>New hires out-earn long-timers doing the same job </li>
<li>Managers negotiate inconsistently, based on their own comfort level </li>
<li>Recruiters guess at offers, unsure what’s “competitive”</li>
<li>Employees question fairness and transparency</li>
</ul>
<p>A clear strategy and direction for compensation gives your team a common playbook to work from. It saves time, builds trust, and gives everyone more confidence in the process.<br><span style=""font-size: 20px;""></span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">What Belongs in a Compensation Framework?</h2>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">1. Your Compensation Philosophy</h4>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Compensation%20Framework%20Blog%20Images.png"" width=""261"" height=""326"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Compensation Framework Blog Images"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 261px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">A compensation philosophy is your organization’s guiding principle for how you think about pay. Do you want to pay at market, above, or below?<br>Will you reward tenure, performance, or potential? Do you aim for internal equity or market competitiveness first?  A clear philosophy helps keep decisions aligned—even when hiring for very different roles.  </p>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">2. Job Levels and Architecture <img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Compensation%20Framework%20Blog%20Images%20(1).png"" width=""330"" height=""413"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Compensation Framework Blog Images (1)"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 330px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 0px 10px;""></h4>
<p>As companies grow, job titles can get inconsistent fast. A job architecture brings order. It means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear levels (e.g., Associate → Manager → Director) </li>
<li>Consistent expectations for scope, decision-making, and impact </li>
<li>Aligned titles across functions  </li>
</ul>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">&nbsp;</h4>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">3. Market Pricing</h4>
<p>You need current, relevant data to price your jobs—especially in fast-changing markets. Determining salary ranges that match your budget and keep you competitive in the market calls for decisions that are grounded in current data. It sounds simple, but selecting what type of data you need, how many different sources to compile, and then actually analyzing the data is no small feat. Whether you’re participating in multiple surveys from large providers or seeking a single data set like BetterComp Prime, your focus should be on finding current data. Using the most updated data possible gives you fresh, role-specific benchmarks that reflect what’s happening in today’s labor market—not last year’s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">4. Salary Ranges</h4>
<p>Ranges give you structure by clearly outlining how an employee should be paid based on various filters such as experience, performance, location, or time in role. These ranges help managers avoid negotiating from scratch and support internal equity since they are responsive to different factors you may encounter when hiring new employees.</p>
<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">5. Policies and Guidelines</h4>
<p>Your framework should include clear guidelines for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting salaries for new hires </li>
<li>Raises and promotions </li>
<li>Adjustments for equity or retention </li>
<li>When and how to share pay information with employees <br> </li>
</ul>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">The ROI of a Compensation Framework</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">When you invest in getting compensation right, you get more than just a smaller number of tabs or spreadsheets open on your screen. For faster hiring, a clear compensation framework helps your team make quick, market-aligned hiring decisions with more consistent negotiations. New hires won’t be the only ones impacted by your compensation foresight—compensation is also a huge aspect of your <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/compensation-can-make-or-break-employer-brand"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">employer brand</a></span>.&nbsp;</span><br><span style=""font-size: 18px;""></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""font-size: 18px;"">Clearer budgeting and workforce planning can help improve retention (especially for top performers),  reduce risk of equity and compliance issues, and empower managers to explain pay decisions.  BetterComp customers have reported reducing offer turnaround time by days and improving manager confidence in pay conversations significantly. One Head of People shared:<em> “We stopped arguing over what the number should be and started focusing on the right hire.”</em></span></span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">How to Get Started</h2>
<p>You don’t need a fully built system on day one. Here’s how to start small and scale over time:</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; padding-left: 40px;"">1. Define your comp philosophy</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; padding-left: 40px;"">2. Select key roles to benchmark</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; padding-left: 40px;"">3. Create initial salary ranges for common roles or job families</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; padding-left: 40px;"">4. Document policies and train hiring managers</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; padding-left: 40px;"">5. Refine over time as your business and team grow</p>
<p>It’s better to start lean and iterate than to wait until everything’s perfect. For a rapidly growing team, compensation is a key part of your business strategy, your culture, and your ability to grow.</p>

<h2>Building a Solid Job Architecture</h2>
<p>Compensation is an undeniable pillar of talent management, and solidifying your job architecture can help ensure your team is appropriately positioned within a hierarchy, compensated for the correct level of work they’re completing, and &nbsp;provides a consistency that simplifies compensation benchmarking.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Aligning%20Job%20Architecture%20and%20Market%20Data%20for%20Compensation%20Success_May%207%202025.jpg"" width=""450"" height=""253"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Aligning Job Architecture and Market Data for Compensation Success_May 7 2025"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 450px; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"">Deloitte provides a maturity model for clients to evaluate the current status of their job architecture, and we had a great discussion on why job architecture is so imperative to compensation programs. No matter where you fall on the maturity model, job architecture isn’t a stagnant un-changing part of your program. In fact, every time you hire someone new or adjust an existing employee’s title, your job architecture probably needs another look.</p>
<p>Recognizing that job architecture is a bit of a moving target can feel intimidating, but its smaller subtasks like job leveling will help:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Improve pay equity and reduce internal compression</li>
<li>Enhance career progression visibility for employees</li>
<li>Support total rewards strategy across regions/functions</li>
<li>Make it easier to scale talent programs like incentive pay, LTI eligibility, or internal mobility</li>
</ul>
<p>One very special part of our webinar you’ll want to rewatch is Sheila and Jeremy’s overview of Deloitte and Empsight’s <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""http://JAsurvey.com"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">Global Job Architecture Practices Survey</a></span> results. This survey allows participants to weigh in on the status of their current job architecture, offer insights on how job architecture is impacting compensation practice, and evaluate how their current model may need to be adjusted. During the webinar, we were lucky to have Sheila and Jeremy share some key insights from the survey, and if you participate in the survey now, you can get the full 2025 results.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style=""font-weight: normal;"">Finding a Market Data Fit</h2>
<p>I lead a team that’s focused on making market pricing better, but we recognize that getting started with salary benchmarking isn’t a small endeavor. For teams that may be searching for ways to introduce survey data or who are aiming to make sure their survey data is in lockstep with their job architecture, our panelists shared a few common struggles and how to help ease the transition:</p>

<h2>Progressing in Your Job Architecture Journey</h2>
<p>Once you’ve gotten a jump on job architecture, the fun doesn’t stop! Progressing through the maturity model is not a simple checklist—it might get messy and it’s a unique journey for every organization. Recognizing your starting point empowers you to identify the different steps you could take to move your job architecture toward maturity.<br><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Our panelists offered a few points of advice for moving your journey forward, no matter your starting point:</span></p>

<p style=""font-size: 18px; font-weight: normal;""><span style=""color: #474554;"">Whether you’re just beginning your job architecture journey or you’re well established with a wealth of survey data, making sure these two elements are aligned is a sure-fire way to keep your compensation program competitive and successful. We can guarantee that there will continue to be changes to the job market, economy, and compensation benchmarks, but a well-defined program allows you to make adjustments as they come up rather than starting from scratch every time.</span></p>

<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">Can you share a brief overview of your professional background and how you ended up in your current role?</span></strong></h2>
<p>I was an educator for over a decade before transitioning into the HR SaaS space as a Customer Success Manager. In my first role outside of higher education, I quickly saw how transferable my background was—skills like onboarding, teaching, training, and navigating complex policies translated seamlessly into managing a book of business, building strong client relationships, and driving adoption.</p>
<p>I’ve brought that experience into my current role as the third Customer Success Manager at BetterComp, where I’ve played a key role in shaping how we support and scale our growing client base. &nbsp;Across my career, I’ve stayed focused on deeply understanding each client’s goals and challenges, using those insights to inform strategic planning, and drive long-term success with the product.<br><span style=""font-size: var(--fs-post-body); font-weight: var(--fw-post-body); letter-spacing: var(--ls-post-body); background-color: transparent; font-family: var(--ff-post-body); color: var(--clr-text-lt);""></span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">Describe your role at BetterComp:</span></strong></h2>
<p>My days at BetterComp are very busy and meeting-heavy! I spend most&nbsp;of my time on client implementation calls, leading ongoing customer meetings and trainings, and participating in internal discussions around product rollouts and upcoming compensation cycles. When I’m not on calls, I’m advocating for my clients across internal teams—including data, support, sales, implementation, and development—to ensure alignment and deliver top-tier support.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">What is your favorite part about your job? About working at BetterComp in general?&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p>Working at a startup means everything is always evolving—and I love that! You get to roll up your sleeves and improve processes and workflows every day, which is both exciting and rewarding. I also really appreciate the collaborative culture at BetterComp. The team is incredibly supportive, and everyone’s always willing to lend a helping hand.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">What do you like doing when you’re not at work?</span></strong></h2>
<p>I’m an avid gardener and passionate home cook! My fiancée and I are heading into our third summer in our home, and we’ve been continually working to improve our garden and increase its biodiversity. This year, we’re growing several heirloom varieties of vegetables and herbs, including Hot and Spicy Oregano, Lemon Cucumber, Cocozelle Squash, and Cherokee Purple Tomatoes. One of my favorite things is using every part of a plant—for example, with radishes, I pickle them in a variety of ways, cook with them, and use the tops to make pesto or add to green juice.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold;"">What has been your favorite project or assignment so far? Why was it special to you?</h2>
<p>One of my favorite projects has been leading the refinement of our customer health scoring initiative. It gave me the chance to take a closer look at the indicators that truly reflect customer success and risk – and to ensure we’re using that data proactively, not reactively. I’ve also really enjoyed mapping the customer journey from sales through renewal. That work helped us identify key touchpoints and opportunities to better support our clients at every stage, which has felt really impactful.</p>
<p>What made these projects special was their direct impact on the client experience and the opportunity to collaborate cross-functionally to drive meaningful, lasting improvements. It’s the kind of work that reminds me why I love being in Customer Success.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">Is there a piece of advice you received early in your career that has stayed with you</span></strong><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">?&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p>One piece of advice that’s really stuck with me is: <em><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">“Lead with curiosity.” </span></em>Early on, I was reminded that asking thoughtful questions and genuinely seeking to understand – whether it’s a process, a client’s challenge, or a teammate’s perspective – can completely shift how you approach problem-solving and relationship-building. That mindset helped me transition careers, adapt quickly, and build trust with both clients and colleagues. It’s a simple idea, but it’s made a big difference throughout my journey.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">Share a few fun or surprising facts about yourself that your colleagues might not know.</span></strong><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p>I’m an avid reader—I've already read 22 books this year! I’m especially drawn to memoirs, magical realism, sci-fi, and psychology books. I use the StoryGraph app to track everything, and nothing makes me happier than finding a book that totally pulls me in. I almost always have a book (or two!) going and love swapping recommendations with other readers.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">What’s your favorite place you’ve ever visited and what made it so special?</span></strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>One of my favorite places I’ve visited is Lagos, Portugal. It’s a stunning coastal town with amazing cliffs and quiet beaches. What made it special was the balance between outdoor activities – like hiking along the coast and swimming in secluded spots – and just enjoying the relaxed vibe in the evenings, with fresh seafood and sunsets.&nbsp;</p>

Learn how to find the survey that best suits your comp program and organization.","2025-04-10 11:53:15","<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">For many companies, market pricing is a critical process in compensation planning. It directly affects recruitment and retention, not to mention the bottom line. For that process to work effectively, compensation teams need the best possible data. Whether your company is looking for its first compensation market data or seeking to expand your panel of salary surveys, identifying the best data source for your needs is key.</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Available Salary Data Sources</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Salary data comes in many different forms, some more useful or accurate than others. The most common - and rigorously curated - data type is salary surveys. Surveys vary widely in the data they provide. Some are broad, encompassing a wide range of industries, jobs, and locations. Others are highly specialized niche surveys that focus on specific geographic areas, job categories, or industries.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">A newer market data option is crowdsourced, aggregate data. This has typically been a reference tool for employees when negotiating salary (think Glassdoor or LinkedIn salary information), but increasingly these data sources are marketed toward companies as a low cost option. As a rule, I recommend that compensation teams take this type of data with a grain of salt. It can be useful as a supplement to salary surveys, but typically doesn’t have the statistical rigor or sufficient inputs to support its full use in your market analysis.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Salary Surveys and Compensation Program Maturity</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Depending on the maturity of market pricing practices in your organization, the surveys you’ll be looking at will likely differ. If you’re looking for your first survey, you’ll more likely want one that is relatively broad, but not so broad you have a ton of extraneous data to eliminate. For example, for a business with a highly localized workforce, a local association survey, which covers a wide array of jobs and industries, but is geographically focused might be your best choice.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">On the other hand, if you have several (or many) surveys, you’re likely hunting for some pretty specific data to round out your market coverage. For instance, maybe you just expanded into a new location and concluded that your survey data is insufficient to meet the need there; maybe you completed an acquisition and need more data for a new industry vertical.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Maturity-scale-for-survey-data.png"" alt=""Maturity-scale-for-survey-data"" width=""4074"" loading=""lazy"" style=""width: 4074px;""></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Whatever your reason for needing new survey data, there are several key elements to consider to help find the survey or surveys that are right for your business.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Evaluation Considerations</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">When looking at different surveys, you’ll want to think about both factors related to your business as well as factors intrinsic to individual surveys. Each element is important, though the weight you give them will vary depending on your specific needs.</span></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 28px;""><span style=""color: #434343;"">Business factors</span></h3>
<h4 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>Talent Competition</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Your talent competition landscape is the top factor for survey selection. All other business-related factors feed into it - jobs, industry, size and geography. Remember, talent competition is not the same as business competition. If, for example, your workforce is highly localized but you work in an industry like software as a service (SaaS), you may be competing with nearby companies outside your industry for local talent as well as other tech companies who are hiring remotely.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Most surveys will provide a participant list. This is invaluable if you've come up with a list of the companies with which you compete for talent. A survey that includes direct talent competition is almost always going to be more useful than one that doesn't.</span></p>
<h4 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>Jobs&nbsp;</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Think about the type of jobs you want to fill. An accounting firm may be competing primarily with other accounting firms for tax and audit accountants, but they’ll still have to hire - and pay - administrative staff, marketing, IT support, etc. This means that their talent competition for core accountant jobs is likely different than for those non-accounting positions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">As you’re evaluating data sources, think of the core jobs that make your company run - whether accountants, machinists, retail associates, or software developers. Also think about your entire <a href=""https://www.bettercomp.com/blog/jobs-to-job-architecture"">job architecture</a> and be sure to have a data source or sources that provide market information for those, as well.</span></p>
<h4 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>Geography</strong></span></h4>
<img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Stock%20Photography/Market-expansion-world-map.png"" alt=""Market-expansion-world-map"" width=""377"" loading=""lazy"" style=""width: 377px; float: right; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"">
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Geography, again, isn’t necessarily about the markets you sell into, but </span><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">about the places your employees live and work. The big push into remote work over the past several years has made geography much more complex for a lot of businesses, as has the trend toward pay transparency laws requiring companies to include salary ranges in their job postings. Understanding what to pay a developer in New York City vs. one in rural Tennessee is vital for companies hiring remote employees. (For more on this, our CEO Alan Miegel has a great article on <a href=""https://www.bettercomp.com/blog/compensation-conundrum-navigating-pay-for-remote-teams"">compensation for remote workforce</a>.) Geography also comes into play when looking to expand into new markets or transition from a domestic to a global workforce.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Your data source(s) should cover all the geographic areas in which your employees live and work. Having robust, accurate market data that supports your compensation philosophy for geographic locations is crucial for effective recruitment and retention.</span></p>
<h4 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>Industry</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Your industry may be a greater or lesser factor in your choice of survey. If you’re a highly specialized business where many of your employees would be unlikely to explore opportunities outside your industry, this could be a major element in finding the right market salary data. If you compete for talent across a variety of industries, it might be of lower importance.</span></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 28px;""><span style=""color: #434343;"">Intrinsic Survey Considerations</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Beyond aligning with your talent competition, you’ll want to understand how the survey is structured and the methodology used in analysis. Even self-reported, crowd-sourced, or aggregate data can be useful with the appropriate methodology (though, I’d caution against using that as your primary data source, regardless of methodology).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Most companies, particularly those that are looking at their first salary survey, will need to consider cost and participation requirements. Good surveys are expensive. To help mitigate the cost - and because surveys are only as good as their input - most survey vendors will offer a discount for survey participation. In this process, you provide your de-identified employee job and compensation data to help build the base of validated salary information in the survey. It’s important you know the information your vendor will want and participation timing so you can plan effectively.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Don’t Be Afraid to Ask for Help</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">This may all feel like a lot, but remember that you can ask for help. It’s in survey vendors’ best interests to make sure their data is a fit for your company. You can also ask your market pricing technology partner for help in finding the right survey to meet your needs.</p>

Here's how you can use comp and benefits going forward.","2025-03-14 10:41:46","<p>Everyone’s talking about the<a href=""https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/ftc-announces-rule-banning-noncompetes"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span> </span><span style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"">FTC’s new rule</span></a> banning non-compete agreements and dissolving any currently in place. Speculation is running wild about how it will affect businesses, employees, and the entire talent landscape. One thing is clear to me, though: this ruling signals a pivotal moment in how businesses leverage compensation and total rewards strategies to support talent goals.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Some Background on Non-Competes</span></h2>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Stock%20Photography/Non-Compete%20Agreement.jpg"" width=""340"" height=""255"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Non-Compete Agreement"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 340px; float: left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px;"">Traditionally bundled with confidentiality and non-solicit agreements, non-competes were either targeted narrowly (e.g., named companies) or broadly (e.g., all companies in the HR technology space). Companies used non-competes to ""lick the cupcake"" (employee) so key talent was harder to poach and less likely to look for employment elsewhere.</p>
<p>In the event an employee left for a competitor or a competitor attempted to lure away an employee with a non-compete, both parties risked anything from a nasty-gram saying “hands off” to lawsuits and court hearings. Sometimes employers would choose not to enforce non-competes with no repercussions at all and sometimes the courts would decide the agreement wasn’t enforceable, but it was a roll of the dice.<br><br>Now, the game has changed…</p>
<h1 style=""font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">The Carrot and Stick of Talent</span></h1>
<p>There are two key ways of getting people to do what you want: rewards and repercussions, or the carrot and the stick. Non-competes were a stick – threat of negative consequences for the undesirable action of leaving to work for a competitor. Compensation, however, is a carrot – rewarding the desirable behavior of staying with an employer. Without non-competes to tie employees to employers, compensation now stands as the most potent tool for employers to retain top talent, fostering loyalty and aligning employees' interests with the organization's success.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">Using the Compensation Carrot</span></h3>
<p>Within comp packages, equity has traditionally <img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Stock%20Photography/Carrot%20or%20Stick.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""300"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Carrot or Stick"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 300px; float: right; margin: 10px 0px 10px 10px;"">been one of the biggest retention hooks – equity granted at a lower value with a vesting schedule over multiple years could mean a payoff at a multiple of an employee’s annual comp years down the line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, for companies without equity available to grant (or without increasing equity values), the shift away from non-competes necessitates a recalibration of compensation structures. Employers may face pressure to make up the difference in value through higher salaries or other financial incentives, ensuring competitiveness in the talent market while maintaining employee satisfaction and engagement. This transition underscores the need for organizations to adapt their compensation strategies to remain attractive employers of choice in an evolving landscape of talent acquisition and retention.</p>
<p>In revising compensation packages, compensation teams and HR departments will need to strike a balance between competitive salaries and sustainable financial practices. While higher salaries may serve as a short-term solution to compensate for the loss of non-competes, companies must carefully consider the long-term implications on their bottom line and organizational culture. Moreover, relying solely on salary increases may fail to address the broader issue of employee engagement and retention, highlighting the importance of holistic compensation and talent strategies that encompass both financial and non-financial incentives.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">Rewards Beyond Compensation</span></h3>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Stock%20Photography/Talent%20Puzzle%20.jpg"" width=""300"" height=""300"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Talent Puzzle "" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 300px; float: left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px;"">Compensation is a critical piece to the talent attraction and retention puzzle, but this new world without non-competes presents an opportunity for companies to explore alternative means of incentivizing and retaining talent beyond traditional compensation structures. Employee benefits, professional development opportunities, flexible work arrangements, and a positive work culture are just some of the non-monetary factors that can play a crucial role in attracting and retaining top talent.</p>
<p>By investing in these areas, companies can differentiate themselves as employers of choice, fostering a workplace environment that prioritizes employee well-being, growth, and satisfaction. As the competitive landscape of talent acquisition continues to evolve, organizations must remain agile and innovative in their approach to compensation and employee retention, leveraging a diverse array of strategies to meet the evolving needs and expectations of the workforce.</p>
<p>This ruling falling in the current flurry of return-to-office mandates is particularly interesting. The RTO push was signaling more of a buyers’ market, but with&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.hrotoday.com/news/only-5-of-employees-prefer-working-in-the-office/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span> </span><span style=""color: #467886; text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">95% of employees wanting some sort of remote work</span></span></a> and the stick of non-competes disappearing, companies may once again need to bend to meet employees’ demands.</p>
<h1 style=""font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Going Forward</span></h1>
<p>The dissolution of non-compete agreements will reshape the compensation landscape for employers and employees alike. With the removal of restrictive clauses, employees gain increased mobility and flexibility to explore new opportunities and pursue career growth without fear of legal repercussions.</p>
<p>And, as employers turn their focus towards total rewards levers to achieve their talent goals, employees will benefit from higher compensation packages and a greater emphasis on overall well-being and job satisfaction. With that focus, the removal of non-competes from a company’s talent arsenal could actually lead to a new era of heightened engagement, satisfaction, and productivity. Only time will tell.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Each of these approaches comes with its own set of opportunities and risks. In reality, most companies aim to leverage a combination that is tailored to their unique profile and needs. Determining the appropriate mix is where the real challenge begins.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 24px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">The Reality: A Hybrid Approach&nbsp;</span></strong></span></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Most companies choose a hybrid approach where they strategically lead the market in certain areas while matching or lagging in others. But how do you determine which roles you should pay above market? The key lies in collaborating with your leadership to determine your company’s competitive advantage and critical success factors. Once those priorities are identified and agreed upon, you can develop a compensation strategy that aligns.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">For example, in an accounting firm, accountants represent core roles that directly drive the firm's success. Therefore, it is logical to lead the market for these positions. However, the importance of a role isn't always tied to its core business function. That same accounting firm might also choose to offer above-market pay for cybersecurity and IT professionals. Because even though these roles aren't directly related to accounting services, they're crucial for protecting sensitive financial data and maintaining client trust—making them strategically vital to the firm's success.</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The answer to what is considered a core and critical role can vary widely across companies and industries. Consider law firms—many prioritize hiring from certain schools because the status and alumni networks of prestigious institutions (e.g., Harvard Law) may help draw high-profile clients. In this case, they may choose to lead the market for graduates of specific institutions, while taking either a lag or match approach for others.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 24px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">Creating Value Beyond Base Pay</span></strong></span></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Most companies, if they can afford to, will try not to lag the market across all parts of the organization for extended periods. Doing so can greatly increase the risk of decreased morale and high employee turnover. However, in some cases where budgets are very limited, organizations may have no choice but to choose this approach. This doesn’t mean that your company is doomed to sub-par talent and continual poaching. With a compelling mix of non-monetary benefits and creative compensation structures, you can still create a holistic total rewards package that attracts and retains a talented workforce.</span></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 24px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Leveraging Benefits&nbsp;</span></strong></span></h3>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Examples of non-monetary benefits may include generous vacation policies, flexible work arrangements, and a clear path to professional growth. Or if you are a mission-driven non-profit, employees who strongly connect with your mission may find meaningful job satisfaction, even if salaries are less competitive.</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Organizations can also differentiate themselves by providing benefits that offer substantial value to employees who need them. Fertility benefits are a prime example. Just <span style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">one cycle of IVF can cost </span></span><a href=""https://www.goodrx.com/conditions/fertility/ivf-costs"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">$15,000-$30,000</span>.</span></a> Not every employee will need this benefit, but for those who do, it can be profoundly meaningful and often more financially valuable than a modest increase in base pay. Beyond boosting morale, targeted benefits like these can be cost-effective alternatives to increasing base salaries across the board. Other examples of benefits like these may include student loan repayment programs, mental health support, or housing stipends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 24px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong><span style=""color: #000000;"">Leveraging Short-Term and Long-Term Incentives&nbsp;</span></strong></span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">You can also get creative with your compensation structures by leveraging spot awards,&nbsp; short-term incentives, and long-term incentives. As the name suggests,<span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span><a href=""https://www.aihr.com/hr-glossary/spot-award/#:~:text=A%20spot%20award%20is%20a,both%20monetary%20and%20non%2Dmonetary."" style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""font-weight: bold; color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">spot awards</span></a> are “on the spot” and examples of this include gift cards, company swag, social-media shout outs, and more. <a href=""https://www.imercer.com/articleinsights/the-basics-of-sti"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">Short-term incentives</span></a> are rewarded to employees within a year or less and examples include team performance awards or annual bonuses. Examples of <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.mercer.com/en-us/insights/total-rewards/total-rewards-strategy/long-term-incentives-the-basics/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;"">long-term incentives</a><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span></span></span>(LTI) include restriction stock units and long-term performance shares. Leveraging these incentives can be an effective way to motivate your employees beyond just base pay.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">While these strategies can help organizations manage cash flow by paying out rewards later or tying it to certain performance metrics, it's crucial to ensure you are not disconnecting the incentive from performance. Heavily delaying payouts for achieving targets or offering irregular recognition can dilute the impact of the reward and blur the connection to performance. Remember, the goal is to keep employees excited and motivated, so these incentives should feel timely, relevant, and clearly tied to their contributions.</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 18px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Benefits and incentives are not just levers for companies lagging the market. Base pay, while very important, is only one component of your total rewards package. All companies should consider the full spectrum of compensation strategies to create an attractive and sustainable total rewards package that keeps employees motivated and committed for the long term.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 24px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">Defining “The Market”&nbsp;</span></strong></span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">In the context of compensation, we hear the term ""the market"" all the time—whether it's leading the market, lagging the market, or figuring out the market rate. The list goes on. However, it’s important to highlight that “the market” may look very different from one company to another because the market reflects <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.humanresources.pro/compensation-market-what-is-it/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;"">the organizations your company competes with for talent</a><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">.</span></span></span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Using data sets and cuts that are relevant to your organization’s size, industry, and geography is essential to ensure you are making meaningful comparisons. For example, a small regional manufacturing company could be misled if it benchmarks against large global corporations operating in vastly different environments with significantly different budgets. So before you decide whether to lead, lag, or match the market, take the time to define what ""the market"" means for your organization.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 18px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">With how fast the world of compensation moves today, having a clear view of the market through reliable data sources is a major competitive advantage. <a href=""/blog/how-to-determine-the-aging-factor-for-compensation-data"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Aging your data</a> appropriately helps provide a more accurate reflection of current market conditions. Modern compensation technology like <a href=""/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">BetterComp</span></a> can also help you manage this data effectively by identifying patterns and outliers that reveal important insights for more precise, timely compensation decisions.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 24px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">How often should you review and adjust your compensation strategy?</span></strong></span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">You should review your compensation strategy at least once a year. You may not need to make adjustments every time, but it at least provides an opportunity to reassess the impact of current strategies. Think of it like checking your car's speedometer—you need to know how fast you're moving to make a conscious change to your behavior. This is particularly important because once you start lagging the market, it can quickly become a cumulative problem that compounds over time. That small lag you have today could evolve into a significant competitive disadvantage by next year, making it increasingly difficult and expensive to play catch up. Implementing regular reviews can help you spot potential risks early so you can make proactive and strategic decisions about when and where to adjust.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 24px;""><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">The Path Forward</span></strong></span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">There is no one-size-fits all approach to compensation today, and figuring out the right strategy for your company goes beyond simply choosing to lead, lag, or match the market. Success starts with deeply understanding the specific context of your market, company profile, and specific goals. Remember that competitive compensation goes beyond base pay. Partner with your HR and Benefits leaders to design a holistic rewards strategy that leverages incentives, benefits, and growth opportunities to create a competitive advantage. Leverage regular reviews, relevant data, and compensation technology to gain the insights you need to make compensation decisions that are both competitive and sustainable.</span></p>

<p>Here are some of the main highlights from this enlightening discussion:&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Context is key for effective compensation programs</strong></h2>
<p>These days, it’s no longer enough for comp pros to look at pay in isolation. Having additional context and an efficient way to make sense of it is critical to making strategic and timely decisions. This shows up in 3 key ways:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level=""1"">External factors can’t be ignored because context is critical to understanding how compensation works. As Yanina explained, comp pros are essentially becoming “economists for the country that they are responsible for…because just looking at the compensation itself tells you very, very little.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Compensation is transitioning to Total Rewards. With economic impacts on businesses and employees, companies are leaning on comp pros to deliver win-win solutions. Yanina highlighted that in addition to base pay and bonuses, comp pros are also working closely with their benefits team to “optimize that full package and get the best ROI for both the employee and the employer.”&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Data is in demand. Companies are upping their survey purchases <em>and</em> supplementing with alternative sources of data to gain a clearer, more complete picture of the market. The same company that used to buy 1 survey now buys 3, while the ones that bought 2-3 surveys are now buying 4-5 and an alternative data source. Companies that bought a dozen are now buying 40…the quest for good data is only increasing.</li>
</ol>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;""><strong>AI has the potential to reduce a lot of the friction we see in compensation market pricing today</strong></span></h2>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Stock%20Photography/Business%20Intelligence.png"" width=""255"" height=""255"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Business Intelligence"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 255px; float: left; margin: 5px 20px 20px 0px;"">Regardless of our personal feelings on the topic, AI is already here and starting to shape the future of compensation. Heather pointed out that currently, the primary focus is on leveraging AI to replace repetitive tasks, and ultimately “pull friction out of that whole highway of compensation data usage.” This includes streamlining of many processes from collecting and cleaning data all the way to creating and analyzing data sets.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The presence of AI doesn’t mean that comp pros will suddenly find themselves out of jobs. However, it does suggest that the responsibilities for comp pros will be evolving. As Heather explained, those previously tasked with routine work will now have the opportunity to oversee and refine machine learning models.</p>
<p>Sam also emphasized two skills that are expected to be highly valuable as a result of AI development: ""You should be asking very good questions. You should be very focused on the business mindset."" Essentially, it’s about being able to effectively prompt AI and use it to your advantage, so you can focus more time and energy on developing skills as a strategic partner. Sam suggested that just as we have HR Business Partners today, ""Compensation Business Partners” will soon become a more prevalent role.</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #2f3139;"">There’s a lot to be excited about, but AI definitely has its limitations. Sam called out an important point that “the best AI is going to be underpinned by the best data.” Ephraim offered another spin to this and highlighted the impact that AI will have, not just on compensation data, but the workforce itself and how it may change the way we define jobs. AI is revolutionizing the way we work, enabling us to process information and operate more efficiently than ever before. Those who learn to leverage AI to help them be better at their work will become more productive overall. </span></p>
<h2><span style=""color: #405caa;""><strong>There is a future for alternative data but not as a replacement for traditional survey data</strong></span></h2>
<p>The increasing need for more context, paired with technological advancements, has led to the emergence and growth of alternative data sources.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Stock%20Photography/Data%20Analysis.png"" width=""397"" height=""207"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Data Analysis"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 397px; float: right; margin: 10px 20px 10px 30px;"">Our panelists discussed a variety of data sources with differing levels of validity and accuracy. Unsurprisingly, though with good reason, the consensus is that survey data remains the gold standard for compensation programs. That said, there’s definitely a place now and in the future for alternative data. Examples include <a href=""https://www.trycompa.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>Compa</span></a>, <a href=""https://www.levels.fyi/?compare=Zappos.com,Skillz,Amazon&amp;track=Software%20Engineer"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>levels.fyi</span></a>, and many others.</p>
<p>As changes come thick and fast in compensation and talent, companies are looking for ways to stay ahead of the curve. Diversifying their data sources is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great way to get another layer of validation and more timely insights as the market moves. Doing this the right way means creating a comprehensive data strategy that includes alternative data sources alongside traditional surveys.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;""><strong>Data providers have a duty to meet changing demands of the workforce responsibly</strong></span></h2>
<p>The current landscape has sparked a demand for more frequent and more forward-looking data. Data providers, new and old, bear the responsibility to meet these evolving demands responsibly. What does this look like? Ephraim outlined a framework that dives into three key areas: data-privacy, antitrust, and pay transparency. Each of these key areas can fill a dissertation on its own but here are some of the highlights Ephraim offered:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Those distributing data have a responsibility to create products and uphold a space that promotes pay equity and prevents collusion.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Companies have a responsibility to be transparent with employees about how their data is being used, and data collectors have a responsibility to understand and uphold privacy laws.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">When it comes to compensation, there is a lot of discussion around staying competitive and attracting talent but it is just as important to make sure the internal consistency and equity holds together as well.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a lot of new regulations, varying in both degree and complexity across regions. It can be a lot for comp pros to keep up with. In this climate, Heather emphasized the importance of working with survey providers that are transparent with how they are addressing and adhering to these regulations. Your survey provider(s) should be helping you understand and navigate the landscape instead of just being purely transactional.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;""><strong><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Icons/Lightbulb%202%20color.png"" width=""120"" height=""139"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Lightbulb 2 color"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 120px; float: left; margin: 0px 20px 0px 10px;"">Candid advice from our panelists</strong></span></h2>
<p>To wrap up the webinar, our panelists shared valuable insights for organizations looking to leverage compensation data and stay competitive:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level=""1"">Consider different perspectives and have some flexibility. This means, don’t just look at the 50th percentile or the median. It’s more important to understand your compensation philosophy along with how that fits in with the breadth of what’s happening in the market.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Have your compensation strategy and determine whether or not you have the data to support it. Strategy without data isn’t actionable, and data without strategy is just numbers.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Peer groups have changed overtime but most organizations have yet to review and update them. It’s important to know where you are hiring from and where you are losing talent - whether it’s a particular function or location.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">As more and more teams hire internationally, it’s becoming increasingly crucial for organizations to have a compensation strategy that is globally consistent but also locally relevant. This means ensuring upholding pay equity across your organization while adapting to local legislation and market conditions.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Top talent is expensive and not everyone is going to be able to afford it for every single role in the organization. It’s essential to identify your critical roles so you are clear on where to focus your investment.&nbsp;</li>

<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">Over the next few years, we can expect to see an influx of new regulations, technology, data sources, and vendors — probably more than we can even imagine today. This rapid pace of change can be overwhelming. In these moments, the notion of trust becomes more and more crucial. This includes trust in your data, trust in your vendors, and trust in your strategy. It will be increasingly critical to work with other organizations and leaders who uphold utmost integrity and accountability, ensuring a strong partnership to navigate the changes together.</span></p>

<p>Over the past several years, the economy has occupied a major place in the comp world’s collective mind. The post-COVID-19 pandemic years saw inflation skyrocket which, in part, drove that nightmare time that still haunts HR leaders, the great resignation. Combine inflation with quarterly threats of recession, and the result is business leaders (and their comp teams) warily watching the economy like most of us are watching for winter storm predictions on our weather apps.&nbsp;<br>While the Fed has done its work to cool inflation, it seems to have found its level and is remaining steady, if slightly high. Those promised recessions never quite materialized either. I anticipate that, at least in the U.S., things will keep moving along in the same way they have for the past year or so.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #002071;""><strong><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Icons/Orange%20circle%20icons/Icon-Global-OC.png"" width=""53"" height=""53"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Icon-Global-OC"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 53px; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;""></strong></span><span style=""color: #002071;""><strong>Pay Transparency Goes Global</strong></span></h2>
<p>As you may have heard, a new administration recently took up residence in Washington D.C. For pay transparency advocates, that means that even though many states have opted to enact their own requirements, the likelihood of <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.payscale.com/compensation-trends/?_search=legislative&amp;_topic=pay-transparency"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">national legislation or direction on pay transparency</a></span> is at least four years away. Meanwhile, countries in the European Union (EU) are beginning to roll out their action plans related to the EU’s pay transparency directive.</p>
<p>This murkiness adds a further layer of complexity to an already fragmented landscape. While US-based companies will still have to contend with the variety of regulations - from municipal to state-wide - and the growing expectations of employees and job seekers related to pay transparency and equity, companies with employees outside the US are contending with an even larger patchwork of regulations.

<p>Comp pros have always lived by their data. That’s not changing, but I’ve seen a trend toward companies increasing the volume and variety of data they use in their compensation processes.&nbsp;<br>Comp teams are not only purchasing more surveys, but are increasingly supplementing their survey data with alternative data sources like Compa’s offers data, scraped job posting data, and even aggregate data sources.&nbsp;<br>At BetterComp, we’re working to support our customers in both the quantity and variety of data they use. In addition to our Prime Market Data, Powered by Mercer, which offers a reliable dataset to companies with fewer than 1000 employees, we recently <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250205081775/en"" rel=""noopener"" style=""text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;"">announced our integration with Compa</a></span> that seamlessly brings offers data into customers’ market pricing processes.</p>

<p>We’ve already seen movement in the <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://intellizence.com/insights/merger-and-acquisition/largest-merger-acquisition-deals/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">M&amp;A space this year</a></span>. The incoming administration promises to be friendly to M&amp;A with a light regulatory touch. In addition, the continued (however slow) lowering of interest rates and expected $3 Trillion in uncommitted capital indicate a high likelihood of more M&amp;A.<br>In the comp &amp; HR arena, Deel’s recent <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.deel.com/blog/deel-acquires-assemble/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">acquisition of Assemble</a></span>’s innovative team is a harbinger of things to come for comp and HR teams. Moreover, many companies in the comp and HR space are owned by private equity or other holding companies, providing fertile ground for transition of ownership. Late stage private equity is not known for investing in the hottest trends or innovation, so while M&amp;A activity is likely to spike in 2025, that won’t necessarily mean a huge leap forward for technology.</p>

<p>The past year saw a lot of movement in the world of flex work. Return-to-office (RTO) mandates took center stage as high-profile companies like Amazon and JPMorgan began bringing their teams back full-time.<br>By this point, most companies have found the work style that suits them. Many companies (like BetterComp) remain committed to a fully distributed workforce, while more are embracing a hybrid approach, with a few outliers mandating exclusively in-office work.<br>Comp teams are used to conversations and negotiations, but in 2025, discussions on work locations will be straight to the point as most companies have settled into a system that works for their company’s goals and needs.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #002071;""><strong><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Icons/Orange%20circle%20icons/Icon-Survey-OC.png"" width=""53"" height=""53"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Icon-Survey-OC"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 53px; margin: 0px 20px 0px 0px;""></strong></span><span style=""color: #002071;""><strong>The Comp Market Hits a Reset Point</strong></span></h2>
<p>The past four years have been quite a ride for comp teams. From the pandemic (which now somehow feels like ancient history), the great resignation, and spiking inflation and economic uncertainty, to advances in technology including the huge leaps forward in AI, comp teams have had to deal with a LOT. And that included some major shifts in how - and how much - companies were paying.<br>At this point, the wild fluctuations that characterized the early 20s have calmed and pay is leveling off to a more reasonable, steady rate that matches the more subdued levels of inflation we’re also seeing. While this is a much needed reprieve for comp teams, it also comes with challenges - specifically, how to handle top talent that’s come to expect regular 5-10% increases or managing talent acquisition when people coming in are paid above where the market is today. Recent years’ salary jumps created a group of candidates who saw huge compensation increases when accepting new positions, which as a result, left them earning salaries that exceed market range. In 2025, we will see a new reality set in where salaries for new positions may be closer to candidates’ current compensation.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #002071;""><strong>What’s Next for BetterComp?</strong></span></h2>

These 5 best practices can help compensation teams achieve a successful market pricing technology implementation.","2025-03-14 10:16:24","<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Whether you’re starting off with your first market pricing software or replacing an underperforming solution with one that’s a better fit, getting implementation right is key to your long-term success. After years of helping companies implement market pricing technology, I’ve got some tips for making your implementation as seamless as possible and setting your team up for the future</span></p>
<!--more-->
<h2 style=""font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: #474554;"">1. Choose Your Time</span></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">While there’s no real down time for comp pros, there are certainly more optimal points in the cycle to bring on a new solution. If you’re not constrained by an expiring contract with your previous vendor, you can choose the time of year where implementing new market pricing technology will produce the least disruption.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">This generally depends on how your annual merit cycle aligns with data migration and survey participation. Most comp teams find that the space between survey participation and annual data migration is the best choice for them, but if your fiscal year ends in July and you’re working on merit increases, that might not work for you. Look at how your team’s workload ebbs and flows and lean on your chosen partner for advice.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">If possible, one of the best ways to choose your time is to implement alongside your existing solution - whether that’s spreadsheets or a legacy technology - and transition tasks to your new software as appropriate. We had one customer implement BetterComp a full year before their previous vendor contract was up, and it made for a truly seamless transition.&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 20px;""></span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: #474554;"">2.&nbsp; Plan Ahead</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">At BetterComp, you can walk into implementation totally green and we have the knowledge and experience to walk you through it. That said, customers who are prepared and have a clear plan have faster, easier implementations. One of my customers was able to go live in just 2 weeks, made possible by their well-developed plan.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Start off with people. Who on your team - and on other teams like IT - will be involved and what will their roles be? Assign a point person for your implementation to own your deliverables and work directly with your new partner.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Next, think through your goals. Based on your workload, what are the tasks that need to be accomplished in your new software first? This is particularly important if you’re up against the clock with your previous vendor‘s contract expiry approaching.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Finally, think through your timeline. You’ve already done your best to choose the optimal point in your cycle to bring on new software, but understanding when you need to go live and what you will be working on at that time will help you and your new partner create a viable project plan for your implementation.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: #474554;"">3. Gather Your Data</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">In comp, we live and die by our data. To assure a smooth, easy implementation, make sure you have all your data readily accessible. This includes your survey reports in spreadsheets - not PDF format; employee, job, and range information; pricing policies such as geo differentials or premiums; and currencies.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Policies-Procedures-Binders.jpg"" alt=""Policies-Procedures-Binders"" width=""350"" height=""234"" loading=""lazy"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 350px; float: left; margin: 10px 15px 10px 0px;"">You’ll also want to pull together all your documentation for structure, processes, and procedures. Having things like your job architecture, how your levels map to your surveys, which data cuts you use, your general approach to job pricing and exceptions to that approach documented and assembled before you begin implementing your new market pricing software will help streamline the process. If you don’t have a lot of this information documented, this is a great excuse to develop and formalize that documentation for the future.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: #474554;"">4. Over Communicate</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Communication is key to a successful implementation - both internal and external. You want to make sure that your team and stakeholders outside your team know what is happening. You also want to be certain that you understand the deliverables on your end and that your partner is clear on your expectations and goals.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">That said, you don’t want to overwhelm your team with minutiae. The majority of your communication should route through your point person who is owning the implementation for your team. They will be best positioned to provide updates to the broader team and from your company to your market pricing technology partner. They should also be empowered to bring in other members of the team throughout the process if and when called for.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Beyond your team and partner, you’ll want to ensure that senior leadership, department heads, recruiters, hiring managers, and other people throughout the organization that rely on your team understand what is happening, the expected timeline, and how the implementation may affect requests from the comp team.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 28px; font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: #474554;"">5. Don’t Forget Onboarding</span></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">A lot of people mix up onboarding and implementation, or assume that onboarding is a given. The reality is that no matter how user-friendly your new system is, your team will <img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Team-learning-software.jpg"" alt=""Team-learning-software"" width=""350"" height=""376"" loading=""lazy"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 350px; float: left; margin: 10px 15px 10px 0px;"">need both training and some time to become familiar with your market pricing solution. Expecting expertise after one training session isn’t realistic.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">When I’m working with a new customer, I always include training that’s tailored to their near-term goals and work. As the team gets deeper into using the system, we have self-service training resources available.

"Build Your Business Case for New Comp Technology: 5 Easy Steps","Build Your Business Case for New Comp Technology: 5 Easy Steps","https://www.bettercomp.com/blog/build-your-business-case-for-new-comp-technology-5-easy-steps","Increase the chances of getting your new comp technology approved by building a clear business case. These 5 steps will get you closer to your goal!","2025-03-14 08:09:42","<h2>What is a Business Case?</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Simply put, a business case is a document used to objectively evaluate a business initiative relative to other priorities. It outlines the request, reasoning, needs for implementation, and projected benefits. For comp pros exploring either bringing in new technology, this means outlining how the benefits outweigh the costs and what you intend to achieve by purchasing or changing technologies.</span></p>
<!--more-->
<h3>Do I Really Need One?</h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Most decisions you make in your day-to-day work don’t require a business case. No one, at least no one I know, puts a business case together about where to grab a cup of coffee. Whether you need one for comp initiatives is going to depend on your organization’s approval processes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">However, I recommend building at least a simple one even if it’s not required. Mainly because a business case helps bring clarity and objectivity to decisions. It’s easy to only look at the potential up-sides of a software purchase, but creating a business case will force you to evaluate the costs and resource allocation required to help determine if moving forward is really the best decision for your company and department. Having a business case can also make your proposal stand out vs. other internal initiatives that haven’t done that work.</span></p>
<h2>Creating Your Business Case</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Business cases can range from relatively simple to enormously complex. For purchasing or transitioning to a new comp software solution, your business case will likely be fairly straightforward. Afterall, you’re not proposing launching a new product or acquiring a competitor. I’ve boiled it down to 5 simple steps.</span></p>
<h3>1. Understand Your Audience</h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Who will be reviewing your request and approving your software purchase or partner change? Knowing who will be evaluating and ultimately green-lighting your request will help you build a business case that has more chance of success. That doesn’t mean leaving out potential pitfalls or skipping information. It does mean highlighting the benefits that will mean the most to the person or people who have purchasing power.<img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Two-people-working-together.jpg"" alt=""Two-people-working-together"" width=""300"" height=""336"" loading=""lazy"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 300px; float: left; margin: 10px 10px 10px 0px;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">As part of understanding your audience, you’ll also want to put together your business case in a way that they’ll be able to understand and digest. For example, a busy executive team won’t want to read a 5-page document but will be more open to looking at a couple slides.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Ask your favorite comp technology provider to help make your business case. Oftentimes they have examples from other customers, such as slides with great visuals, or can provide feedback on your business case to improve your chances of success. They’re not successful unless you’re successful, so use their willingness to help to your advantage.</span></p>
<h3>2. Define Your Goals</h3>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">One of the most important components of a business case is stating why a change is needed. I.e. what’s broken that needs fixing? It may be that something isn’t working well or there are sticking points in your process; it could also be an opportunity for improvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Executives think in blunt terms, usually framed as either moving towards a positive or moving away from a negative.&nbsp;</p>
<ul style=""font-size: 20px;"">
<li aria-level=""1""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">What good thing happens if we do this? (moving towards a positive)</span></li>
<li aria-level=""1""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">What bad thing happens if we don’t do this? (moving away from a negative)&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Executives know that every new initiative has <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>opportunity costs</span></a> and systems always have some <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/switchingcosts.asp"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;"">switching cost</a></span>. You’ll need to address these head on or they could sink your ask.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">If you can align your why to your broader organizational goals or initiatives, this becomes even more powerful. Think of these as a train leaving the station - can you attach your car to the train and get brought along? Think through the understanding you have of your audience - whether it’s your CHRO or board of directors. How can you tie your goal back to their objectives and needs?</p>
<h3>3. Identify Your Solution</h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">If you’re building a business case, you’ll likely have a preferred solution that you’re ready to choose. Part of your business case should give a quick overview of how you came to that conclusion. What steps did you take to arrive at your choice? What alternatives did you evaluate? What you’re really doing here is proving you’ve done your due diligence.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">If you need help with that part of your process, check out <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/choose-your-next-market-pricing-software-five-best-practices"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;"">my post</a></span> on evaluating potential market pricing solution partners.</span></p>
<h3>4. Outline Resource needs</h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">This is going to be one of the more detailed elements in your business case. This will include the financial investment for your solution, as well as resources needed for implementation - think of these as people, time, and money - all are costs in different ways.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">If you have a preferred vendor, they will be able to help you gather this information. It’s often a good idea to get thoughts from other departments, specifically HR Operations or IT, on their current capacity and the expected resources needed. You may not be able to provide the exact number of hours implementation and set-up will take, but even providing t-shirt sizing guidelines (S, M, L, XL) on the effort it will take from individual departments should be sufficient. </span><br><span style=""font-size: 20px;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Examples of other similarly sized customers and how long their process took can help firm up estimates.</span></p>
<h3>5.&nbsp; Show the Benefits</h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Some people confuse the expected benefits with the why behind the ask. And the benefits you outline should tie back to the problem or opportunity outlined in your business case. However, when you’re detailing the expected benefits to your solution, you’ll want to be more specific about exactly what and how your new technology will impact your business and department. Numbers always speak louder than words but need to be well thought out and reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Goals%20and%20benefits.svg"" alt=""Goals and benefits"" width=""400"" height=""400"" loading=""lazy"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 400px; float: left; margin: 0px 0px 28px;""><span style=""background-color: transparent;"">Not all benefits have to align directly with your stated goals. A goal around getting better customer service from your technology partner may not be terribly compelling to an executive who’s not the one receiving poor service. But, if you can show how poor service is inhibiting you from achieving a business result, then talk about what missing that business result will do to the business - the benefit is the value of achieving that result.</span></span></p>

<p data-offset-key=""8kk6j-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""8kk6j-0-0"" style=""font-size: 20px;"">The connection between wages and inflation is complex and nuanced, but you don’t need to be an economist to grasp the basics. As a compensation professional, understanding this relationship can help you learn more from your market data and develop compensation strategies to match economic circumstances. Here’s what you need to know about inflation, wages, and how the two interact and affect each other.</span></p>

<p data-offset-key=""9qdat-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""9qdat-0-0"" style=""font-size: 20px;"">Let’s start with a quick primer on inflation. Inflation often gets billed as a terrible, looming threat. And runaway inflation can indeed be disastrous.</span></p>
</div>
<p data-offset-key=""3r0on-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""3r0on-0-0"" style=""font-size: 20px;"">For example, in the 1920s, Germany experienced such dramatic inflation that the event was named the <a href=""https://blog.nli.org.il/en/inflation/"" rel=""noopener"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">Weimar Hyperinflation</span></a>, after the government in charge. At the peak of the hyperinflation, a single US dollar was worth 4.2 *trillion* of the German currency, the Mark. A single loaf of bread cost billions.</span></p>
<p data-offset-key=""3r0on-0-0""><span style=""background-color: transparent; font-size: 20px;"">Most inflation isn’t anywhere near the level of “you need to be a billionaire to buy lunch.” In some conditions, economists even consider inflation a good thing. ‌The U.S. Federal Reserve, the institution in charge of monetary policy, spends a good deal of time managing inflation. One of the Reserve’s fundamental strategies is to not only allow for inflation but to target an annual inflation rate of several percent.</span></p>
<p data-offset-key=""1ftun-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""1ftun-0-0"" style=""font-size: 20px;"">If this sounds crazy, I assure you, it’s not. The Fed sets inflation targets for good reason. Without inflation, the economy will get to a point where it can no longer grow. In this scenario, individual companies can be profitable but any gains they make come exclusively at the expense of other businesses. There just isn’t enough money for everyone to increase their profits.</span></p>

<div data-block=""true"" data-editor=""fqcit"" data-offset-key=""cdpoh-0-0"">
<p data-offset-key=""cdpoh-0-0""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Yes! Inflation causes the price of everything to rise, from your daily cappuccino to the labor your company hires. Economic growth and subsequent inflation gives the appearance that wages are rising. The average hourly compensation rate in the U.S. in 1964 was $2.50, and in 2018 it was about $22.65.While that seems like a massive increase, the relative value of that money has shifted.. After all, a loaf of bread no longer costs $0.25 either.<span style=""background-color: transparent; color: #f58220;"">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

When adjusted for inflation, $2.50 in 1964 would be worth $20.27 in 2018. In half a century, the actual pay of most workers has only increased by about 10%. That small increase isn’t caused by inflation; it’s the actual increase in how employees are valued in the U.S.</span></p>

<p data-offset-key=""crsic-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""crsic-0-0"" style=""font-size: 20px;"">Also yes! When factors like tight talent markets or labor shortages cause companies to raise their compensation levels, this influx of disposable income can drive up demand and therefore increase prices.</span></p>
<div data-block=""true"" data-editor=""fqcit"" data-offset-key=""p4bn-0-0"">
<p data-offset-key=""p4bn-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""p4bn-0-0"" style=""font-size: 20px;"">Higher wages also can influence inflation when companies who have raised their compensation rates need to fund that increase somehow. Few businesses are so profitable that they can fund the entire compensation increase without changing their practices, and many that have that flexibility don’t want to eat into their profit margins. That money has to come from somewhere, and the simplest solution is to raise prices.</span></p>
</div>
<p data-offset-key=""ckq3l-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""ckq3l-0-0"" style=""font-size: 20px;"">Eventually, prices and wages reach a new balancing point. The cost of consumer goods in general rises to fund the new, higher wage rate. This is called “wage push inflation” because the increase in wages pushes the market to have higher prices.</span></p>
<div data-block=""true"" data-editor=""fqcit"" data-offset-key=""1b1pb-0-0"">

<p data-offset-key=""1hht6-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""1hht6-0-0"" style=""font-size: 20px;"">Wages and inflation aren’t always in sync, and there are differences in how inflation is reflected in compensation across industries, at different job levels, and even in different parts of the country. Looking at wages on aggregate doesn’t always give the complete picture. It’s possible for some jobs or industries to see major wage spikes without wages in general creeping up that much. Alternatively, it’s possible to see wages growing on the whole while some job categories, industries, or markets continue to stagnate.</span></p>
</div>
<p data-offset-key=""6dfer-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""6dfer-0-0"" style=""font-size: 20px;"">Today, wages and inflation are not lining up. The current levels of inflation are not being caused by wage increases; in fact, despite compounding with worker shortages, base salaries <a href=""https://www.wtwco.com/en-US/Insights/2022/01/2022-salary-budgets-with-worker-shortages-why-arent-they-higher"" rel=""noopener"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">haven’t increased as much</span></a> as we might expect.

<p data-offset-key=""94ctm-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""94ctm-0-0"" style=""font-size: 20px;"">Some of this comes down to cost of labor vs. cost of living. Much of what market pricing does is provide insight into the cost of labor for a given role, job family, or geography. Unfortunately, market pricing data today is typically behind the reality your employees and hiring managers are facing, meaning that the comp professionals who keep an eye on economic factors will be stronger business partners and see better success in recruitment and retention.</span></p>

Today, the average is $210,200. While workers earn slightly more on average, the cost of a house has more than doubled. Apartments have gotten more expensive, too. The cost of renting an apartment has increased 72% even after inflation adjustments. As a result, a greater percentage of workers’ paychecks is being allocated to housing, leaving less for other necessities - or even luxuries.</span></p>

"Your Job Architecture Secret Weapon: A Global Job Catalog","Your Job Architecture Secret Weapon: A Global Job Catalog","https://www.bettercomp.com/blog/your-job-architecture-secret-weapon-a-global-job-catalog","A global job catalog is a critical tool for developing and maintaining consistency in job data and compensation across jobs and geographies. ","2025-03-13 10:31:18","<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">The first step in any compensation or job architecture project is understanding what jobs actually exist in your organization. Building and maintaining a global job catalog ensures that you have this information readily available if and when you need it.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px; margin-top: 24px;"">What is a Global Job Catalog?</h2>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 16px; font-size: 20px;"">A global job catalog is a comprehensive database of all the job roles within an organization. It includes information such as job titles, job descriptions, job families, job levels, and salary bands. Basically, your entire job architecture is outlined in your job catalog.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 16px;""><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Job-puzzle-pieces.jpg"" alt=""Job-puzzle-pieces"" width=""300"" height=""344"" loading=""lazy"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 300px; float: left; margin: 10px 16px 10px 0px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">To begin developing a job catalog, you will need to identify each unique job within your organization. People can share the same job, such as an Administrative Assistant. You will need to group like jobs together and identify each unique job. Once identified, you will need to create a unique job code for each unique job.</span></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 16px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">It’s important to note that a job is defined differently than a position. A job can be shared among many employees. An example of this is a Sales Representative. You can have 100 people in the same Sales Representative job. These 100 people will share one job code for a Sales Representative. However, each person will have a unique position. Therefore, 100 people who are Sales Representatives will have 100 different position codes. Positions are tied to the employee. Jobs can be shared among numerous employees.</span></p>
<h2 style=""margin-top: 24px; font-size: 36px;"">Using Your Global Job Catalog</h2>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 16px; font-size: 20px;"">The catalog is designed to be accessible to all employees and serves as a central source of information. As such, it supports a number of HR functions and objectives, including:</p>
<ul style=""font-size: 20px;"">
<li style=""color: #2f3139;"" aria-level=""1"">
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">Talent Acquisition: Your job catalog can be used for job postings when it’s time to fill a position. If your catalog includes job descriptions, job levels, competencies, and skills, it makes job posting a breeze.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
</li>
<li style=""color: #2f3139;"" aria-level=""1"">
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">Talent Management: Developing a career framework in your job catalog assists with transparency of career progression.</span></p>
</li>
<li style=""color: #2f3139;"" aria-level=""1"">
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">Performance Management: Including competencies and skills in your job catalog can assist in offering a consistent performance management program throughout your organization.</span></p>
</li>
<li style=""color: #2f3139;"" aria-level=""1"">
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">Learning &amp; Development: Employees who want to develop within their role can use their job catalog to develop skills needed for other roles.</span></p>
</li>
<li style=""color: #2f3139;"" aria-level=""1"">
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">Benefits: Certain benefits may only be available to certain job levels or job families. Having a job catalog enables appropriate filtering of data to ensure the correct groups receive those benefits.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">And, of course, compensation teams see immense benefits from the job catalog, as well.</span></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 36px; margin-top: 24px;""><span style=""color: #474554;"">Compensation and Your Global Job Catalog</span></h3>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 16px; font-size: 20px;"">A global job catalog provides a standardized framework for categorizing job roles and responsibilities, which can help organizations create a consistent compensation structure across different geographies and ensure that they are paying their employees fairly.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 16px; font-size: 20px;"">The consistency that comes from a formalized job catalog that defines job roles and responsibilities is critical for accurate job matching. That translates to easier benchmarking and survey data analysis. Market pricing is an essential component of compensation planning, and a global job catalog makes it easier to compare compensation data across different geographies and industries. This helps organizations benchmark their compensation packages against competitors, ensuring that they are competitive in the market.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 16px; font-size: 20px;"">A global job catalog is also a tool to support pay equity and compliance with the growing body of pay transparency legislation. Including pay bands or job-based ranges in your global job catalog and making it accessible to your entire organization puts you in compliance with the current California law, which is the most stringent pay transparency legislation in the U.S.</p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 16px;""><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/HR-job-architecture-icons.jpg"" alt=""HR-job-architecture-icons"" width=""1200"" height=""494"" loading=""lazy"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 1200px; margin: 10px 0px;""></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 16px; font-size: 20px;"">As companies expand globally, a global job catalog is increasingly essential. The standardized approach to job titles and descriptions promotes equity and consistency in pay and career progression, helps to identify skill gaps and opportunities for career development, ensures compliance with local labor laws and regulations, and improves organizational agility and flexibility. Investing in a global job catalog will better equip your organization to attract and retain talent, stay competitive in the market, and drive your business forward.</p>

I’ve witnessed a lot of selection processes: those that ended with very happy buyers and those that ended with buyers regretting their choices. There’s no way to be 100% certain when buying software, but the following best practices definitely increase your odds of picking the solution and partner that will be best for you and your team. To help simplify your market pricing solution selection, I've pulled together five best practices to follow and a few key tips to help during the decision making process.</span></p>
<!--more-->
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">1. Look at More Than One Solution</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">This may seem obvious, but bringing variety into your evaluation is the best way to make sure you’re getting the best solution for your team. Even if you’re relatively satisfied with your current vendor, reviewing alternatives can open your eyes to capabilities you may not have even imagined.</span></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px; text-align: center;""><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #e65c19;""><em><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Key Tip:</span> As you look at different solutions, don’t be afraid to adjust your selection criteria based on what you see.</em></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">The best way to manage evaluating a lot of different options is to start with a long list. Get ideas from your peers across HR and compensation or use sites like <a href=""https://www.g2.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;query=market+pricing+compensation"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">G2</span></a>, <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://vendordirectory.shrm.org/category/compensation/technology-compensation"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"">SHRM</a></span>, or<span style=""text-decoration: none;""> </span><span style=""color: #0600ff;""><a href=""https://worldatwork.org/resources/vendor-directory"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; color: #0600ff; text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #355bba; text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">World at Work’s</span></span></a></span><span style=""text-decoration: none;""> </span>vendor listing to identify potential options. Remember, these sites include or are exclusively paid listings, so they're not necessarily comprehensive. (Since you’re here, you may as well include <a href=""/solutions"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">BetterComp</span></a> as a potential partner!) Starting with your big list, do some research. In addition to other comp pros and review sites like those mentioned above, company websites will give you an initial idea of capabilities and fit. From here you can narrow down to the technologies you want to demo.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Through the demo process, it’s important to bring in additional members of your team. Anyone who will be working in the platform on a regular basis should at least have an opportunity to evaluate options and ask questions. This may take a couple meetings, but is well worth it when you make a selection and it comes time to implement (or stay with your current vendor).</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">2. If Possible, Avoid an RFP</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">An RFP can be a useful tool in evaluating vendors, but it’s not always the best option, especially for smaller decisions like market pricing software. RFP processes are time-consuming and cumbersome - not just for vendors, but for buyers, too. What’s more, when RFPs are led by procurement, they’re often structured in a way that makes evaluating competing solutions <span style=""font-style: italic; background-color: transparent;"">more </span><span style=""background-color: transparent;"">difficult.</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">It’s not always possible to avoid an RFP, but it’s always worth exploring. A few ways I’ve seen people avoid RFPs for comp software include:</p>
<ul style=""font-size: 20px;"">
<li aria-level=""1""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">If you already have a solution, you could argue that by not requesting new budget, there’s no need for a formal procurement process</span></li>
<li aria-level=""1""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">Explaining that there are only 2-3 major market pricing vendors in the space. If you have one and you’re moving away from it, there is only BetterComp and one other qualified provider out there!</span></li>
<li aria-level=""1""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">RFPs are typically for ERP type systems - hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars. While you’re welcome to pay that much for your favorite market pricing solution, most don’t cost that much. 😉</span></li>
<li aria-level=""1""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">RFP processes take months - longer than it typically takes to implement a market pricing system like BetterComp. We’ve had customers go-live in less than 2 weeks - just reading the RFPs will take longer than that.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #e65c19;""><em><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Key Tip:</span> Even if you believe that avoiding an RFP isn’t possible, ask. If you don’t ask, the answer is alway no.</em></span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">3. Secure Budget for Compensation Software</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">If you have an incumbent solution, you already have an idea of what your budget is. But, if this is your first foray into buying technology solutions to support your market pricing, you’ll want to at least get an idea of what you can spend.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Companies that are entirely new to compensation software may need some guidance. Prospective vendors can give you a rough idea of what the annual or monthly subscription cost may be for their technology to help provide guidance.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">It’s important to not just look at price. Vendors offering solutions with a price that are drastically lower than other providers generally have price points that are not sustainable - they won’t be able to provide great service and support and rates that don’t let them hire great people.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">4. Define Partner Selection Criteria</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">When you’re thinking about evaluation, you’ll want to include things like features and price, but also what criteria are important to you in a partner and how you want the relationship to look. Things like support model, product roadmap, and customer satisfaction should all be part of your evaluation.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Start by thinking about the status quo. What’s working well and what could stand to be improved? This is the time to dream big and imagine what compensation would look like in a perfect world. It’s not critical to name specific features you want, so much as it is to think about what you want your software to help you achieve. However, if you have software in place now, be sure to consider the “why” behind the features you consider important.</p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px; text-align: center; font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #e65c19;""><em><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Key Tip:</span> If you know you’re coming up on the end of a contract in the next year, begin documenting what’s working well and where your sticking points show up.</em></span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Once you’ve built out your dream list, begin ranking by importance. It’s unlikely that any one software or company will be able to give you everything on your list, but it’s also vital that your core needs are covered by any solution you choose.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">But it’s important to choose only features you actually use. Remember, you’re buying a <em style=""background-color: transparent; display: inline !important;"">market pricing </em>solution. Your main question should be “does it do market pricing well?” Too often, we’ve seen buyers ask about features they’re never going to use. As an example, merit modeling sometimes comes up in the course of an evaluation. Would it be nice to have a place you could model cost adjustments? Sure - but not if the core market pricing functionality was so poor that your data doesn’t work for merit modeling. <br><br>We recently polled comp pros on our <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/bettercomp/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; color: #3473f2;"">LinkedIn page</a></span> about how they use their market pricing solutions—check out these results:</p>

<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Should you be basing your decision on something you have a 3% chance of using?</p>
<h2 style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 36px;"">5. Keep Your Eyes on the Prize</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Evaluating technologies can be a big lift - particularly for comp teams who are already working at capacity. As you go through the process, remember why you’re performing the evaluation and keep focused on the outcome - a compensation technology partner that’s the optimal fit for your organization and team.</span></p>

","2025-03-13 08:35:32","<p>For a lot of businesses, making any major purchase means conducting a formal evaluation, most commonly in the form of a Request for Proposal (RFP). Done well, an RFP can be a valuable tool in evaluating different vendors or solutions; done poorly, RFPs can devour precious time and actually impede teams in finding the right solution(s) for their needs.</p>

<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;""><strong><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Icons/RFP-icon-2clr.svg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""RFP-icon-2clr"" width=""200"" style=""width: 200px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"" height=""200"">Understanding RFIs, RFPs, and RFQs</strong></span></h2>
<p>Before diving into the nuts and bolts of crafting an effective RFP, let’s cover off on the terminology. A Request for Proposal (RFP) is a formal means of evaluating multiple vendors. Alternatively, there can also be a Request for Information (RFI) and a Request for Quote (RFQ). RFIs are typically used for gathering preliminary information, while RFQs come into play when you have enough data to make a decision and simply require pricing comparisons.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;""><strong>Do We Need an RFP?</strong></span></h2>
<p>The short answer is “Maybe”. Many enterprise organizations require an RFP for any new purchase, and sometimes even for contract renewals. However, an RFP isn’t always the best way to evaluate and purchase compensation technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, your purchase process will be much quicker and have fewer obstacles without an RFP. The compensation technology industry is home to just a few market pricing solutions; there are rarely entirely new offerings (BetterComp notwithstanding), so evaluating is relatively simple compared with other technologies. In addition, most large organizations already have a solution in place, so budget allocation typically isn’t an issue. As a result, comp teams often have success circumventing an RFP process by <a href=""/blog/build-your-business-case-for-new-comp-technology-5-easy-steps"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>building a solid business case</span></a> and showcasing that they’ve already done their due diligence.</p>
<p>In the event an RFP is required, it’s critical to make sure your RFP document and process is designed specifically for your needs related to compensation technology. Here’s how to do that.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;""><strong><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Icons/Participant-icon-2clr.svg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Participant-icon-2clr"" width=""150"" style=""width: 150px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"" height=""150"">Choose Your Participants</strong></span></h2>
<p>Finding the right companies to participate in your RFP is as important as the document itself. Putting in a bit of time up-front can save you a lot of headaches and wasted time later on.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>DO: Do Your Research</strong></span></h3>
<p>Having a clear understanding of the marketplace is essential before going to RFP. Make sure you know what all your options are. Ask peers, check places like the World at Work or SHRM directories, and leverage sites like G2 to identify potential solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>DO: Get Clear About Your Needs</strong></span></h3>
<p>Before you embark on an RFP, it’s critical you have a clear idea of what you’re looking for. Think about your processes, resources, and roadblocks. Work with your team to understand what’s working well and where there are areas for improvement. Build out what you want your future state to look like, and divide things into must-haves and nice-to-haves.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>DO: Develop a Short List</strong></span></h3>
<p>Start off developing a short list by doing discovery and taking demos with the potential vendors you identified. This will help weed out companies that can’t meet your minimum requirements, and help you identify those that are viable candidates versus those that aren’t. Inviting EVERY company to your RFP will just be a waste of time - yours and theirs.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>DON’T: Wait Until the Last Minute</strong></span></h3>
<p>Having enough time in your RFP process is vital. This means starting your RFP prep work early enough to ensure there’s sufficient time for respondents to craft their proposals, your team to conduct their evaluation, schedule any follow-up calls, complete contracting and information security reviews (if required), and most importantly get fully implemented with your new solution prior to any upcoming project or contract deadlines. If you only have a couple months before your contract is up, you might not have enough time to evaluate alternatives, much less embark on a formal RFP process.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;""><strong><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Icons/Building-Icon-2clr.svg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Building-Icon-2clr"" width=""150"" style=""width: 150px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"" height=""NaN"">Building Your RFP</strong></span></h2>
<p>Getting your RFP document right can be the difference between success and failure for your procurement process. The tighter your document, the easier it will be for participants to give you the information you need and for you to evaluate potential solutions. If you want a starting point, check out our <a href=""/rfp-template"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">RFP template</a>.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>DO: Set Reasonable Timelines</strong></span></h3>
<p>With RFPs, as with comedy, timing is everything. When you’re working with procurement on your process, be sure to build in time for participants to ask questions - and for your team to answer them. Also provide plenty of time for them to craft their proposals, and give your team enough time to review, evaluate, and seek clarification on any of their responses. For example, you may feel two weeks is a reasonable amount of time to complete your RFP (if your RFP is relatively simple, it may be), but if Thanksgiving or Independence Day fall within those two weeks, you’re actually only giving people 6 or 7 business days. Additionally, take any other projects that could impact your resources into consideration. If you need an HRIS Specialist to assist with your evaluation, but they’re also implementing a new HRIS module, you will want to factor in that they will be splitting time between projects.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>DO: Be Clear About Your Needs and Expectations</strong></span></h3>
<p>Since you’ve certainly been following my advice on prep work, you have a clear picture of what you want your future state to look like. Share as much about that vision as you can. It will help your participants show how they can help you achieve your goals. It will also help vendors self-select out if they know they won’t be able to give you what you need.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>DO: Give Room for Freedom Within Your Framework</strong></span></h3>
<p>Your RFP should be designed to get information in a way that allows you to compare your options side-by-side. That said, if you’re too rigid in your structure, you may miss the opportunity to get information you didn’t know you needed. Use open-ended questions that allow your participants to showcase their differentiators and specialities.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>DON’T: Ask the Same Question Multiple Times</strong></span></h3>
<p>An RFP process is time-consuming for both you and your participants. Asking for the exact same information in different sections is a waste of their time and yours, even if you’re asking in a slightly different way or in a different section. For compensation technology, you generally don’t need a hugely complex RFP document. Keep it simple and straightforward to optimize the process for you and your participants.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;""><strong><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Icons/Planning-2clr.svg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Planning-2clr"" width=""150"" style=""width: 150px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"" height=""NaN"">Evaluating Responses</strong></span></h2>
<p>If you’ve followed the process up to this point, it will make evaluating your responses easier. Not easy, mind you, but easier. Having a solid evaluation process mapped out will help you make the best decision for your team and company.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>DO: Include Multiple Reviewers</strong></span></h3>
<p>Your colleagues in procurement are almost certainly wonderful people who don’t know much about compensation. That means, you’ll need to have your team involved in the evaluation process. Prioritize primary users and people who will be responsible for the partner relationship.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 30px; color: #6e6f71;""><strong>DO: Give All Participants the Same Opportunities</strong></span></h3>
<p>Keeping an even playing field can be tough, but it’s the best way to ensure you’re making an informed decision. All participants should have access to the same information, the same timelines, and the same restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""font-size: 30px; color: #6e6f71;""><strong>DO: Look at Responses Holistically</strong></span></h3>
<p>Many companies will divide their RFP into sections and split that among reviewers. This makes sense for some things: for example, it doesn’t make sense for IT to be reviewing information about account management. However, it’s important to have at least a couple people reading the entire response to fully understand the capabilities and approach of your potential partners.</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>DON’T: Leave Your Participants Hanging</strong></span></h3>
<p>Optimally, you’ll have given your team enough time to review and discuss the RFP responses, but life is unpredictable and things can happen to throw off timelines. Keep communicating with your participants if timelines get derailed. Likewise, no one enjoys giving bad news, but ghosting companies who’ve put time and effort into their RFP responses isn’t a great look and could limit your options going forward. Ultimately your feedback could provide valuable insights on how they can up-level specific capabilities across all vendors, in order to better meet your needs in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;""><strong><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Icons/Achieve-icon2clr.svg"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Achieve-icon2clr"" width=""150"" style=""width: 150px; height: auto; max-width: 100%; float: left; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 10px;"" height=""NaN"">Partner Selection</strong></span></h2>
<p>Once you’re done with evaluation, the last step is making your final selection. If you’re torn, consider asking follow-up questions or inviting your top two participants to a best and final presentation where they have an opportunity to make their pitch and you have an opportunity to ask questions live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen, congratulations! Whether you’re sticking with your incumbent or transitioning to a new partner, you’ve reached the end of the RFP process and hopefully have found the best partner to meet your needs going forward.&nbsp;</p>

No one can predict the future with absolute certainty, but there are some clear trends in the compensation space that all comp pros should be prepared for. This year, comp pros should expect to see several evolutions in the industry that could have a major impact on their day-to-day.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><span style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">1. Big Changes across the Compensation Technology Space</span></strong></span></p>
<p>Over the past couple years, we’ve seen a lot of movement in compensation technology, and I anticipate those smaller shifts from the past few years are going to build into waves of change in 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, the startups. A few years ago, we saw a lot of new entrants in the comp tech space, many of which raised a ton of venture funding back when the primary requirement was pretty much showing up to a pitch meeting and talking about comp. Some had good products and good business models, some had neither.</p>
<p>Whether venture funded or not, we’re hitting the window in which startups either sink or swim. (Don’t worry, BetterComp is<span style=""color: #374151;""> </span><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katie_Ledecky"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>like Katie Ledecky</span></a><span style=""color: #374151;""> </span>in this analogy as we’re completely self funded.) The companies that can’t quite make a go of it - and even some that are doing OK but not fully achieving growth targets - could be acquisition fodder, either for their customer lists or their technology. I can’t fully predict what will come of this, but it’s bound to be interesting. There are lots of really cool comp startups with good people and technology out there and I know most of them will end up in a good place when everything is said and done.</p>
<p>In other M&amp;A news, rumors have been swirling about Payscale being for sale for the last year or so. While relying too heavily on the rumor mill isn’t wise, there’s not usually <em>this</em> much smoke without a fire somewhere. Regardless of who the purchaser is, history tells us that there’s high likelihood of one or more of the following happening post-sale:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Sunsetting of products to streamline offerings:</strong> Usually the oldest or least up-to-date are the ones that bite the dust. Telltale signs that a product is being sunset include, the stopping of sales (either in total or to a segment of the market), a slowing in product roadmap, and a push to move customers to an overlapping offering. Much of which probably sounds eerily familiar to companies using MarketPay.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Layoffs at all levels: </strong>The new owners will install their trusted people, which can bring a breath of fresh air to a stagnating company or can create a ton of disruption for the customers and people who remain.</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Changes in pricing structure: </strong><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #2f3139;"">Existing customers often see new charges for features that were “free” or included before in the name of higher gross margin. </span>This sometimes happens pre-sale, as well, when the old owner wants to get the most for their investment by showing well on the revenue front.</li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">2. Pay Transparency Picks Up Steam</span></strong></p>
<p>Pay transparency really took the center stage in 2023, and will continue to pick up steam in 2024, with both legislation and cultural expectations fueling that acceleration.

Canadian provinces such as <a href=""https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/how-pay-transparency-laws-are-coming-into-effect-across-canada-1.6649868"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador, and British Columbia (with Ontario hot on their heels),</span></a><span style=""color: #374151;""> </span>have their own regulations around pay transparency. Across the Atlantic, the European Parliament adopted the <a href=""https://www.ey.com/en_ch/workforce/how-to-best-prepare-for-the-recently-adopted-eu-directive-on-pay-transparency"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>European Union’s Pay Transparency Directive</span></a><span style=""color: #374151;""> </span>in March 2023, which aims to reduce pay inequality through increased pay transparency. This directive is expected to be implemented into national law within 3 years and will affect millions of jobs across most of the continent.</p>
<p>But the real mover in the pay transparency space is the major cultural shift in job seeker and employee expectations. In a<span style=""color: #374151;""> </span><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/business/talent/blog/talent-acquisition/why-you-should-include-salary-ranges-in-job-posts"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>recent survey by LinkedIn</span></a><span style=""color: #374151;"">, </span>91% of people said that the inclusion of a salary range affected their choice to apply for a job. That’s backed up by<span style=""color: #374151;""> </span><a href=""https://resumelab.com/career-advice/financial-transparency"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>data from ResumeLab</span></a><span style=""color: #374151;"">, </span>which found that 80% of people wouldn’t apply to a job without a posted salary range. And, while companies can legally get away with posting outrageous or ambiguous ranges, a <a href=""https://www.labmanager.com/job-ads-with-wide-pay-ranges-can-deter-applicants-31594"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>recent study</span></a><span style=""color: #374151;""> </span>found that job seekers tended to respond negatively to very wide ranges, particularly when there wasn’t much explanation around how pay would be determined.</p>
<p>Because of these shifts, adapting to the pay transparency landscape will be crucial going forward. According to insights from <a href=""https://www.reveliolabs.com/news/business/revelio-worldatwork-demand-for-compensation-professionals-soars/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>World at Work and Revelio Labs</span></a><span style=""color: #374151;"">, </span>this need is fueling increased demand for compensation professionals. It’s critical that comp teams start asking questions and implementing strategies to address pay transparency now, if they haven’t already.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">3. AI Hype Turns into AI Value</span></strong></p>
<p>In 2023, we witnessed generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) gain mainstream hype across multiple industries. In 2024, we can expect to see AI start to offer some real value in the compensation landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compensation professionals can expect to see new AI tools available to help streamline their day-to-day tasks. It’s important to note that AI will not replace the critical&nbsp; thinking abilities required from compensation leaders. Instead, AI will allow compensation professionals to work smarter and faster so that they can have increased capacity for strategic work. Developments in AI can help compensation professionals level up <em>especially</em> when used in combination with their knowledge and expertise.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/AI.jpeg"" width=""284"" height=""189"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""AI"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 284px; margin: 15px 20px 10px 8px; float: left;"">As technology advances, compensation professionals will also be expected to level up the function by being knowledgeable of new technologies available to help keep up with demands of the ever-evolving world. For compensation technology providers, this means innovation needs to be at the forefront. As compensation professionals level up, they are going to be searching for tools that meet and exceed their expectations, and companies that are slow to innovate will be left behind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Advice to Comp Pros: Beware of companies loosely throwing around AI as part of their product development. Ask detailed questions about the value it provides to their current function to ensure it’s not just a PR stunt).&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">&nbsp;4. Economic Fluctuations: Inflation Cools But Is Still Sticky</span></strong></p>
<p>In 2024,<span style=""color: #374151;""> </span><a href=""https://apnews.com/article/recession-outlook-business-economists-survey-a6080a08dafdc301ff4f6bca3db1146a"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>Inflation is expected to cool</span></a><span style=""color: #374151;"">,</span> even though it’s likely that interest rates will stay<span style=""color: #374151;""> </span><a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/17/top-economists-unanimous-on-higher-for-longer-rates-as-inflation-threats-linger.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>“higher for longer”</span></a><span style=""color: #374151;"">. </span>This duality presents a complex economic environment that compensation teams will have to navigate.&nbsp;<span style=""color: #6e6f71;""></span></p>
<p>Successfully finding equilibrium amidst these fluctuations will require compensation teams to be more proactive and strategic in their pay strategy than ever before. Compensation professionals will need to remain vigilant and assess how inflation and interest rates impact a company’s financial standing and how this could have downstream effects on various components of compensation strategy such as base salary, Cost of Living Adjustments (COLA), and performance bonuses. As changes will have a direct impact on employees, compensation teams will need to be proactive in communicating changes and addressing concerns to employees. Compensation teams supporting employees globally will need to take an even more nuanced approach and consider the variations in inflation and interest rates around the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">5. Hybrid Models Gain Traction as Remote Work Solidifies</span></strong></p>
<p>Employees today appreciate flexibility and will continue to favor employers who allow them to work remotely at least a few days a week. Even with return-to-office (RTO) mandates, we can expect to see more hybrid arrangements as opposed to a full 5-days in office. RTO can have significant financial impacts on employees including child care, pet care, and transportation. Companies implementing return-to-office mandates may need to adjust their compensation strategy to align with employee expectations and stay competitive in the market. Compensation teams will start to need more data around remote vs hybrid vs in-office programs, and survey companies may start to collect and display this information in their reports as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">6. Need for Increased Market Data</span></strong></p>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Market%20Data%20Option%20B-1.png"" width=""300"" height=""225"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Market Data Option B-1"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 300px; float: right; margin: 20px 10px 10px;"">In order to successfully navigate complex market conditions and balance expectations from stakeholders and employees, compensation professionals will need to do more comprehensive market analysis. In most cases, this will require more market data and diversifying the types of data. Traditional compensation surveys will remain the gold standard due to its high-volume and rigorous research methodology. However, compensation teams may find it beneficial to<span style=""color: #374151;""> </span><a href=""/blog/a-modern-approach-pairing-compensation-surveys-with-real-time-data"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>supplement with real-time data</span></a><span style=""color: #374151;""> i</span>n order to keep up with quick market shifts.&nbsp;<span style=""color: #6e6f71;""></span></p>
<p>As the volume of data grows, compensation teams will need to leverage technology solutions to help them effectively organize, manage, and analyze the data. Efficiency is key in this dynamic market, and compensation teams need to focus their time and efforts on making strategic decisions, and not on manual tasks.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Momentum</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7143283952051445760"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">2023 was an incredible year</a> for BetterComp.

<p>Survey participation is a hectic time with many moving parts, but you have to keep things moving to cross the finish line!

<!--more--><p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">I won’t get into the legal ramifications of these laws or the details of what they mean for companies that have or may hire people working in those locations. However, one key thing sticks out to me: the elevated importance of compensation teams and professionals, and particularly the value of a well-developed market pricing practice, for companies with employees in those states.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 30px;"">Salary Disclosure and Market Pricing</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Companies that need to comply with any state's pay transparency law mandating upfront salary disclosure, are often challenged with what salary range to put on their job postings. The best way to determine that range is with market pricing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">While you <em style=""background-color: transparent; display: inline !important;"">could </em>just wing it and hope that you’re not shooting yourself in the foot by underpricing a crucial job or taking a massive hit to your bottom line by over pricing the same, you’re better off making an informed decision. And that starts with data - your internal data along with external market salary data - most likely from one or more salary surveys. (Commonly used surveys include those from <a href=""https://rewards.aon.com/en-us/solutions/data/compensation-surveys"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #3473f2;"">Aon</span>,</a>&nbsp;<span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.imercer.com/salary-data"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;"">Mercer</a></span>, <a href=""https://www.culpepper.com/Surveys/Compensation/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #3473f2;"">Culpepper</span></a>,&nbsp;and <a href=""https://www.wtwdataservices.com/twds/public/ProductCatalog/products.jsp?sectionName=BROWSECATALOG"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">WTW</span></a>. For more info about selecting the right survey for your organization, you can check out <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/how-to-identify-the-right-salary-survey-data-for-your-company"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;"">our article</a></span>.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Once you have market data that’s suited to your business, you can see where you’re ahead of the market or behind the market for specific families, jobs, or locations. This involves benchmarking individual jobs or developing a <a href=""/blog/jobs-to-job-architecture"" rel=""noopener"">job architecture</a> and aligning internal levels with survey levels, for consistent job matching.</span></p>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Job-matching_BetterComp-screenshot.png"" alt=""Job-matching_BetterComp-screenshot"" width=""1248"" loading=""lazy"" style=""width: 1248px;""></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Beyond data, you need to have a compensation strategy. Should you <span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/blog/compensation-market-strategy-your-competitive-advantage-beyond-lead-lag-match"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; color: #3473f2;"">lead or lag the market</a></span> for different job families? Or pay the same relative to the market across the board? It’s challenging to be pricing jobs without a strategy driving the work.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Armed with your comp strategy and market data, you can extrapolate what a salary range would be for a new position. And, voila! You have the information you need to provide realistic ranges for new job postings.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 30px;"">What About Existing Employees?</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">As you’re going through your market pricing exercise, you may find some pretty significant pay discrepancies. One item of note in California's law is that companies are required to share the salary range for existing employees’ jobs if that employee asks. If you find some major outliers, it might be necessary to increase compensation or make title / role adjustments to ensure that existing employees’ jobs and salaries match your overall structure.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Wooden-figures-in-line.jpg"" alt=""Wooden-figures-in-line"" width=""200"" loading=""lazy"" style=""width: 200px; float: left; margin: 0px 15px 0px 0px;"">Failing to make adjustments for existing employees could create problems. If employees see a job posting for a comparable open position with a salary range much higher than their current pay, well, you can imagine the dissatisfaction that would produce. Similarly, if employees see comparable positions posted with salary ranges well below theirs, they could get the impression that you’re intending to replace them with cheaper labor.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Your market pricing exercise may also uncover discrepancies related to race or gender. We all want to believe that our company is different from the norm, but without a process and structure, it’s easy for those gaps to grow despite our best intentions. Pay equity solutions like the one offered by firms like <a href=""https://synd.io/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Syndio</a> can help address any discrepancies and set up processes to make sure they don’t arise in the future.</span></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 24px;""><span style=""color: #434343;"">It’s Called Pay Transparency, so Communicate!</span></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Once you have your market-based pay structure in place, it’s vital to open lines of communication throughout your organization. Hiring managers need to know how much they can expect to pay new hires; employees need to understand why certain people are getting new job titles or raises. Most importantly, being upfront about how salaries are going to be determined going forward generates trust and goodwill with your employees.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 30px;"">What the Future Holds</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">While pay transparency laws are gaining traction, there’s no clear nationwide standard - yet. I don’t need a crystal ball to see that more stringent transparency rules including the requirement to post salary ranges with job postings are going to crop up in other states, counties, and municipalities. Who knows, maybe even seeing the trend, the federal government will pass pay transparency legislation with an eye toward decreasing fragmentation.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Whatever happens, the shift toward mandated publication of salary ranges is not going to suddenly evaporate. Now is the time for businesses to build their market pricing function to get out ahead of the trend and prepare themselves for the not very distant future.</p>

The biggest goal for businesses that are failing is to convince customers that nothing is wrong, so the team can put things back together behind the scenes. While some firms can manage this, many can’t, and when a business can't, customers suffer.</span></p>
<h2 data-offset-key=""7mbk1-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""7mbk1-0-0"">4 Signs to Watch For</span></h2>
</div>
<!--more-->
<p data-offset-key=""6mpqn-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""6mpqn-0-0"">If your compensation technology provider is starting to fall behind, they won’t tell you about it. Instead, you’ll need to figure it out for yourself. Here are the most common signs that your provider is getting lost and may be starting to collapse. </span></p>
<p data-offset-key=""2tdb1-0-0"">&nbsp;</p>
<div data-offset-key=""e5h71-0-0"">
<h3><span data-offset-key=""e5h71-0-0"">Slowing Support</span></h3>
</div>
<p data-offset-key=""128v4-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""128v4-0-0"">Compensation market pricing technology is one of the few sectors that hasn’t kept up with broader technology trends. Every legacy vendor uses services based appraoch (aka people running around doing things) to do large scale data manipulation. Have you ever sent surveys to your provider and they’ve taken weeks to load them? Have you ever been through a year-over-year update and, after waiting weeks for the “migration” to finish, you’re then left with a pile of “stuff” (to put it nicely) to clean up? It’s slow because they use people to do what the technology should do instead. When people get busy, service slows down or gets sloppy - worse yet, sometimes both. </span></p>
<p data-offset-key=""36r55-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""36r55-0-0"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p data-offset-key=""f1mg7-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""f1mg7-0-0"">Why is this a bigger problem than just waiting a few weeks? If you’re seen survey loading times creep up from 1-2 days to 2-3 weeks, you know there’s a problem, because that’s just the tip of the iceberg - they know it’s slow, and there’s nothing they can do it about. The technology is too old and brittle to keep up with customer needs and they have to band-aid it with people running around. That's no way to run a business if your focus is on customer satisfaction.</span></p>
<p data-offset-key=""d8vhm-0-0"">&nbsp;</p>
<div data-offset-key=""d8vhm-0-0"">
<h3><span data-offset-key=""d8vhm-0-0"">Increased Service Charges</span></h3>
</div>
<p data-offset-key=""2999p-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""2999p-0-0"">Many businesses need to raise prices from time to time, but this should happen only on occasion. Companies that are growing and bringing in new customers don’t need to worry about raising prices to fund growth. At most, they may adjust prices at the time of a multi-year renewal, to keep pace with their own changing costs.</span></p>
<p data-offset-key=""8pk15-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""8pk15-0-0"">When a business is stagnant or showing signs of failure, however, they face a problem. If a customer is locked into a multi-year agreement vendors can introduce a higher level of service at a “premium” and reduce the current level of service to a minimum, all while staying in compliance with their obligations under existing agreement.</span></p>
<p data-offset-key=""alsqn-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""alsqn-0-0"">But that sucks for you as the customer. The great service you’ve gotten for years is now either slow or it costs more just to have the same level of service you had before.</span></p>
<p data-offset-key=""1i21f-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""1i21f-0-0"">Signs that changes in service charges are connected to a business falling behind include:</span></p>
<ol>
<li data-offset-key=""7b4p6-0-0"">
<p><span data-offset-key=""7b4p6-0-0"">Services that used to be bundled together are now separated and cost more when combined</span></p>
</li>
<li data-offset-key=""7b4p6-0-0"">
<p><span data-offset-key=""96hvv-0-0"">Services that used to be free now cost money.</span></p>
</li>
<li data-offset-key=""7b4p6-0-0"">
<p>""New” service tiers are revealed, with higher prices and new names but few or no additional features.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p data-offset-key=""cakv1-0-0""><span data-offset-key=""cakv1-0-0"">When your technology provider starts using these techniques, they probably aren’t innovating and they’re not growing, so they’re looking for other paths to generate more revenue.</span></p>

<h3><span data-offset-key=""1h96b-0-0"">Over-Promised Sales Demos</span></h3>
</div>

"How to Determine the Aging Factor for Compensation Data","How to Determine the Aging Factor for Compensation Data","https://www.bettercomp.com/blog/how-to-determine-the-aging-factor-for-compensation-data","Dive into determining the aging factor for compensation data, from calculating the annual market movement to considering external and internal variables.","2025-03-04 13:30:19","<p style=""font-size: 18px;"">Having spent many years in compensation, one consistent pattern we continue to see is the prevalence of 3% as the annual aging factor in the United States (US). This raises the question: What factors influence this number, and is 3% still relevant in today’s market?&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;""><strong>What does it mean to ""Age Data""?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
<p>Because compensation survey data provides a snapshot of a specific point in time, surveys conducted at different times of the year will have different effective dates. This raises two potential concerns for comp pros:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>With how quickly the market moves, the data may feel outdated by the time it is actually applied.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Because many teams rely on multiple surveys to inform their decisions, comp pros need a way to normalize the effective dates and level the playing field for accurate comparisons.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>Aging data is the process of aligning survey results collected at different times to a common reference point. This is done by adjusting the market data using an estimated percentage that reflects how much you expect the salary to change over time. By aging the data, comp pros can get a more accurate reflection of the current or future market conditions and help their companies be more competitive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s walk through an example. You have 2 different surveys: Survey A has an effective date of January 1, 20XX and Survey B has an effective date of March 1, 20XX. You want to “age” these data sets to the new date of November 1, 20XX.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Table A below shows the calculations and steps needed to appropriately age the data from both surveys.</p>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/TABLE%20A.%20Formulas%20and%20Example%20Calculation%20of%20Aging%20Data.jpg"" width=""2400"" height=""1600"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""TABLE A.

<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;""><strong>What is the Aging Factor?</strong></span></h2>
<p>When discussing the aging factor, you will likely encounter the terms “survey aging factor” and “annual aging factor”. Both are integral components of the same formula:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Figure%201.%20Aging%20Factor%20Formula.png"" width=""1584"" height=""396"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Figure 1.

<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1; font-weight: bold;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Figure 1. Aging Factor Formula</span></p>
<p>The annual aging factor (also known as annual market movement) is the percentage used to age the data. It represents an estimate the company makes about how much wage movement is happening in the given period of time. It is highly subjective and is influenced by internal variables, such as budget, and external variables, such as inflation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The survey aging factor is directly impacted by both the annual aging factor and the specific target date to which the data is adjusted. This factor reflects your decision on how you want to align with current market trends.</p>
<h2><strong>The Science of Determining the Annual Aging Factor (aka Annual Market Movement)&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">The <span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><span style=""color: #3473f2;""><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m3hE2GQY0ow"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""color: #3473f2;"">ASEAN Total Rewards Institute</a> </span></span>shares 2 ways to calculate this:&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;"">1. Determine the average year-over-year change in market salaries of all the jobs you’ve matched to, as in Table B below.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 18px; line-height: 1; font-weight: bold; text-align: left;"">Table B. Example Calculation of Annual Market Movement&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p style=""font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px;"">2. Calculate for 60-70% of the merit or salary budget trend.</p>
<p>For example, if the report states companies in the US are budgeting for a 5% merit increase, your annual market movement will be around 60-70% of that or 3-3.5%.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">Can you share a brief overview of your professional background and how you ended up in your current role?</span></strong></h2>
<p>I started my career as a 4th-grade teacher before earning my Master’s in K-12 Administration. In 2011, I made an unexpected but exciting pivot into the tech world, by joining an EdTech company—and I’ve been immersed in HR ever since. Over the years, I’ve worked in almost every HR function, including learning &amp; development lead, global talent acquisition leader, executive recruiter, global HR leader, operations leader, and now, Head of People. My diverse HR experience has given me a well-rounded perspective on building impactful people programs that help teams and businesses thrive. My passion is working for growth startups bcause I love building out infrastructure and programs that will scale with a company. <span style=""font-size: var(--fs-post-body); font-weight: var(--fw-post-body); letter-spacing: var(--ls-post-body); background-color: transparent; font-family: var(--ff-post-body); color: var(--clr-text-lt);"">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">Describe your role at BetterComp:</span></strong></h2>
<p>As Head of People, I start each day with some planning. I go through my email and slack, pulling out the critical tasks and urgent messages that I need to respond to right away. I then shift into an hour of focus time where I can knock out critical work and prep for important meetings. I usually like to spend my morning focused on strategic projects, like building out programs and documentation that will drive business performance and better the employee experience, and I usually try to have my meetings in the afternoon. I spend about 10-15% of my day answering ad hoc questions that come in from employees and I wrap my day up with another hour of focus time to finish any remaining tasks and knock off any action items that came from my meetings throughout the day before spending a few minutes looking forward to the next day.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">What is your favorite part about your job? About working at BetterComp in general?&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p>What I love most about working at startups is the opportunity to build lean, high-impact people programs that help both employees and the business thrive. The fast-paced environment challenges me to think strategically while staying deeply rooted in employee experience. The highlight of BetterComp specifically is working with a successful, smart, and driven team that is laser focused on making the world of HR easier for folks just like me. It’s a product that I can believe in and relate to!&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">What do you like doing when you’re not at work?</span></strong></h2>
<p>I have an 11-year-old stepdaughter who I absolutely adore and a 14-year-old former street dog who holds a big piece of my heart. I love spending time at home with my family—especially when it involves art projects of any kind. My most recent creation was a hand-embroidered portrait of a friend’s cat as a housewarming gift. When I’m not at home, you’ll likely find me on the tennis court, in a Pilates class, catching some live music, or checking out a new restaurant.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">How do you continue to learn and grow in your role? Are there any particular skills or areas you're currently focused on improving?</span></strong></h2>
<p>You have to keep learning in order to work in tech. Everything changes quickly and as an HR leader, you need to be one step ahead. I joined the People Leader Accelerator (PLA) last year and that has been huge for my growth. My main focus is building out programs that are “right-sized” for the need. I used to get hung up on this idea that, “If I’m a good HR leader, this company would have A, B, and C.” &nbsp;But the PLA has helped me take ego out of it and instead operate in a solution-focused mindset, thinking things like, “In order for this company to hit its strategy/goals, they’ll need A, B, and C.” &nbsp;The right programs are often light and agile, not beautiful and certainly not perfect. But that’s generally what the company needs to move fast! I’m still working on that though. 😊</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">If you could give one piece of advice to someone just starting in your field, what would it&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">be?&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p>Be proactive and own your own career path. Don’t fall into the trap of waiting for your manager to provide opportunities. Look around you, find gaps, pick at problems, pitch solutions, and seek your own opportunity to make an impact.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">Share a few fun or surprising facts about yourself that your colleagues might not know.</span></strong><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p>I’m a dual citizen of the US and Luxembourg, and I lived abroad for four years—one year in Japan (Southern Kyushu in Miyazaki-ken) and three years in the UAE (Dubai).&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">What’s your favorite book/movie/TV show and why is it your favorite?</span></strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>I’m a big consumer of books, movies, and TV shows, so this is a very tough question. I think if I have to narrow it down to the past year, then I’d say my favorite movie has been Robot Dreams. As a stepmom, I’ve found myself drawn into content that centers on non-biological bonds. This specific bond is between a robot, a dog, and some cute little birds. It’s animated, but that didn’t stop me from crying my eyes out in the movie theater!&nbsp;</p>

<!--more-->
<p>We explored what’s driving this shift towards the business mindset today, the challenges Comp Pros face along the way, and how we can overcome these roadblocks to excel in our careers. It’s an invigorating time to be in this space, and I’m excited to walk you through some of the main insights we discussed.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 26px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">What is a business mindset and why is it important?&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p>Having a business mindset is what allows you to position yourself as a strategic partner to the organization, and not just the person who handles day-to-day tasks. Comp Pros with a business mindset excel at 3 things:&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><strong>1. Asking “Why”</strong></span></h3>
<p>They don’t settle for surface-level answers or stick to practices just because that’s how it’s always been done. Instead, they dig deeper to uncover the reasoning behind decisions. This approach is especially critical in today’s era of pay transparency. With pay decisions more visible than ever, organizations and Comp Pros face increasing pressure to justify and explain the rationale behind their compensation practices.</p>
<p>However, this doesn’t mean you need to have all the answers. It means you should be curious. By being open to asking questions and challenging assumptions, you can foster collaboration and drive better outcomes. Nancy shared that many of her most impactful conversations aren’t those where she enters with an answer but rather when she comes with&nbsp; “questions in mind” and is able to “collaborate with whomever [she’s] speaking with to come to a solution.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seeking to understand the “why” and approaching conversations with curiosity can not only help you connect compensation strategy to business outcomes but also build stronger partnerships across your organization.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><strong>2. Tailoring Compensation Strategies to Specific Business Goals</strong></span></h3>
<p>One-size fits all compensation strategies won’t cut it today. It’s no longer enough to just look at benchmarks and check for compliance. Athar emphasized that Comp Pros must understand both what the business aims to achieve and what motivates your team—then design a tailored compensation structure that ties the two together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This involves asking more strategic questions, such as:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">How can we structure pay ranges to attract top talent while meeting organizational goals?&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">What incentives will keep our most valued employees engaged for the long term?</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">How do my compensation decisions impact the business’s bottom line?</li>
</ul>
<p>Finding answers to these strategic questions can help you design compensation structures that motivate your team, support organizational goals, and ultimately move the business forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Noticing a theme? It all starts with asking the right questions. That’s why we've put together a list of questions to help you better understand the business and assess the impact of compensation. Check out our resource: <span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: #3473f2;""><a href=""/business-mindset-guide"" rel=""noopener"" style=""color: #3473f2; text-decoration: underline;"">Compensation as a Business Driver: Understanding Metrics and Strategies</a></span><a href=""/business-mindset-guide"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">.</a></p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><strong>3. Communicating the Link to Business Goals</strong></span></h3>
<p>Understanding your business’s needs and the “why” behind compensation decisions lays the groundwork for developing a business mindset. However, to be a true strategic partner, you must be able to clearly demonstrate your impact to the business leaders. This starts by drawing the line between business objectives and compensation strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, if your company plans to expand into three new geographic regions next year, how can your compensation strategy support that goal? And how can success be measured? Comp Pros who excel as strategic partners effectively communicate how their strategies support key business objectives. In doing so, they demonstrate that compensation is not just a cost but a strategic investment in talent.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 26px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">Overcoming Common Roadblocks In Becoming A Strategic Partner</span></strong></p>
<p>In the webinar, I highlighted three key roadblocks that I see many Comp Pros face on their journey to becoming strategic partners: Perception, Communication, and Resistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s explore what each of these means and the practical advice our panelists shared for overcoming them.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><strong>1. Changing Perception</strong></span></h3>
<p>Compensation has traditionally been viewed as a more tactical function, handling benchmarking and compliance, rather than as a key player shaping company strategy. To change this perception, we need to clearly demonstrate how compensation impacts engagement, retention, and productivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A powerful way to make your case is by backing it up with data. Having proof in the form of reliable data helps ensure that your recommendations resonate with leadership.&nbsp; As Nancy observed, leading total rewards professionals are exploring various data sources and analytics and leveraging these insights to clearly demonstrate their impact on business outcomes. Using tangible evidence to connect compensation strategies to measurable business outcomes helps build credibility, making it easier to shift the narrative and position yourself as essential contributors to the company’s overall success.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 20px;""><strong>2. Improving Communication</strong></h3>
<p>Being a good communicator involves both being a good listener and expressing yourself in a way that resonates with your audience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A big part of this is speaking the language of your business leader by understanding the key words and terminology they use. Having this knowledge can get you on the same page and establish credibility. It’s also important to prioritize what you want to say in a way that reflects what your business leaders really care about. Aligning your message with their priorities can make your communication much more impactful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Athar also emphasized the importance of learning the language by “spending time with the business.” This is because you really need enough knowledge of the product and your company’s goals in order to make a meaningful difference. Attending all-hands meetings from different departments is one way to spend time with the business. By doing so, you can learn the terminology, priorities, and challenges of these different departments. Mastering this can earn you a seat at the table because, as Athar explained, now when you make a case, it’s no longer a random idea you had, but rather “something that is rooted in your understanding of what they're trying to achieve.”</p>

<h3 style=""font-size: 20px;""><strong>3. Managing Resistance</strong></h3>
<p>Long-established companies and professionals can sometimes be especially resistant to changing compensation practices. You can overcome this by building a business case that includes relevant data, industry trends, and projected return-on-investments. As stated earlier, having proof in the form of relevant and reliable data can always make your case stronger. Another way to manage resistance is by partnering with others who support your initiatives. As Nancy explained, ""The more you can network internally and... communicate with colleagues and other folks that can influence [the project], ... the better the result will be. You're going to be able to overcome those challenges because... that leader is hearing... a surround sound of the direction that you should be taking.”</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 26px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">The role of Comp Pros will be evolving in the next 5-10 years</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style=""color: #474554;"">In the next 5-10 years, the role of compensation professionals will undergo significant changes, many of which will be driven by the rise of technology. Today, companies and employees have more access to data and insights than ever before, and this trend is only going to accelerate as technology continues to advance. As this shift happens, it will become even more important for Comp Pros to be analytical and strategic. As Nancy highlighted, technology will be excellent at zooming in and providing details, but it will be up to us to zoom out and “put those pieces of the puzzle together in a compelling way and deploy talent in the right way.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #474554;"">With how fast the compensation landscape shifts, Comp Pros will need to stay adaptive and keep pace with industry trends. As Athar indicated, “we are going to be having to consider things that we didn't do before.” This will require us to stay flexible and curious so we can respond to new challenges and opportunities efficiently and effectively.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #474554;"">Looking ahead, one of the biggest shifts I anticipate is a more diverse workforce. This will demand an even greater need for tailored compensation structures, as well as a more holistic approach to compensation. As the complexity grows, Comp Pros will need to partner more closely with HR, Finance, and business leaders to ensure compensation strategies can meet both the needs of the diverse workforce and the company’s objectives.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #474554;"">Essentially, Comp Pros are going to be playing a key role in this changing world, and having a business mindset will become a must-have skill. By embracing these changes today, Comp Pros can begin shaping their success for tomorrow.</span></p>

<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">Can you share a brief overview of your professional background and how you ended up in your current role?</span></strong></h2>
<p>My first job out of college was with a medical software company, where I served as an implementation consultant. I loved traveling around the country, training new users on how to set up and navigate the software. During those commutes, I always found myself passing the Salary.com building, and I became curious about what went on inside.</p>
<p>After some research, I discovered that a colleague of mine had a friend working there. Thanks to that connection, I got an interview, and before I knew it, I was stepping into the role of Account Manager at Salary.com! Since then, I’ve immersed myself in HR technology, with a particular focus on compensation management, and I’ve enjoyed every moment of this journey. These days, I'm excited to be a Solutions Consultant at BetterComp, where I get to help Comp Pros tackle challenges everyday.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">Describe your role at BetterComp:</span></strong></h2>
<p>Each day varies, which keeps things exciting! I get to work with a lot of different teams. One moment, I’m conducting product demonstrations, and the next, I’m strategizing with colleagues on deals or providing support—whether that’s training or helping out other departments with their questions about the product.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">What is your favorite part about your job? About working at BetterComp in general?&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p>My favorite part of the job is demoing the product. Each demo feels like a performance that I can tailor depending on the needs of the audience. There’s nothing quite like the satisfaction of nailing a customer’s requirements and delivering a fantastic demo. The best part about working at BetterComp, though, is the people—everyone is incredibly nice and supportive. Company culture holds a lot of weight for me.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">What do you like doing when you’re not at work?</span></strong></h2>
<p>I love to read and listen to music. I read all types of genres, but I really like a good historical fiction book. I love the great outdoors, mainly just being in nature. I am also one of the coaches on my son’s hockey team so a lot of my time these days is spent at a rink or driving to a rink.&nbsp; During the summer it’s a similar routine but with baseball.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">How do you continue to learn and grow in your role? Are there any particular skills or areas you're currently focused on improving?</span></strong></h2>
<p>I learn a lot just by talking to customers. I talk to a lot of customers, and I pay close attention to general trends and practices I hear out in the field. Additionally, I learn by doing, making mistakes, and being receptive to feedback.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m particularly focused on expanding my knowledge of AI, which I find extremely interesting and powerful. I’m working on understanding the basics of machine learning and generative AI, but my main emphasis is on AI prompting, because I believe it will be very important to know how to effectively use these incredible tools.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">If you could give one piece of advice to someone just starting in your field, what would it&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">be?&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p>One piece of advice I would give to anyone starting in any field is that it is ok to make mistakes and fail. In fact, personal or career growth is not possible without making a lot of mistakes along the way.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">Is there a piece of advice you received early in your career that has stayed with you?</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">&nbsp;</span></strong>If you make a mistake, own it and grow from it.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">What’s your favorite place you’ve ever visited and what made it so special?&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p>I once got to go to England for a 16 day work trip.&nbsp; During the week, I stayed in a charming smaller town just outside of London, and it was really cool to experience the suburbs of another country and see what daily life looks like there. On the weekends, I had the chance to hang out in London and explore the city. I really enjoyed meeting new people and the eye-opening experiences I had along the way. Plus, I couldn’t resist indulging in fish and chips almost every day!</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">What’s your favorite book/movie/TV show and why is it your favorite?</span></strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>“The Office” is my all-time favorite TV show. It was very relatable at the time, and it brings back memories of gathering with all of my friends back in the day when you had to wait until Thursday night to watch the new episode.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #474554;"">If you could time travel, where in time would you go and why?</span></strong></h2>
<p>I would travel to Egypt while the Great Pyramid was being built to see how the heck they did it!&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Can you share a brief overview of your professional background and how you ended up in your current role?</span></strong></h2>
<p>After freelancing for a few years, I started as a frontend developer at Intergen where I met BetterComp’s CTO, Derek Watson. I joined him on a few endeavors, first writing backend code and then into systems &amp; network programming. We were later acquired and after a few years apart, I rejoined Derek and his team to help scale BetterComp.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Describe your role at BetterComp:&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">I work with the platforms team, building and maintaining the infrastructure and workflows that bring BetterComp to life.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">What is your favorite part about your job and working at BetterComp?</span></strong></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">Picking one favorite thing about the job is tough, because I cannot decide between the work I do and the people I do it with.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">What do you like doing when you’re not at work?</span></strong></h2>
<p>On the weekend I will either be in the garden, apiary, kitchen, workshop, playing music, coding, or off hiking for hours.&nbsp; My kids, whom I affectionately call the “Child Labor Force” are incredible little helpers.<span style=""font-size: 12px; color: #000000;""></span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">What has been your favorite project or assignment so far? Why was it special to you?</span></strong><span style=""font-size: 12px; color: #000000;""></span></h2>
<p>My favorite project has been the release of BetterComp v2.0 which brought several large initiatives together, delivering an enormous amount of capability to all aspects of the system. It was special because given the size of the release, everything (...almost!) worked the first time and for what little was left, the team banded together to get things up and running quickly.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">If you could give one piece of advice to someone just starting in your field, what would it be?&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p>Get really good at the command line: add as many commands to your CLI belt as you can, and then KEEP getting good at them.&nbsp; There is so much to learn and it will take years, but just like watching a master woodworker, there is something so very satisfying and inspiring witnessing a developer deeply proficient in their craft.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Is there a piece of advice you received early in your career that has stayed with you?&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p>Two pieces of advice that have made an impact stick out: “Good programmers think about code. Great programmers think about data structures, their relationships, and their algorithms.” and, regarding building distributed systems, “EVERYTHING fails.”</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Fun Fact:</span></strong></h2>
<p>During the Mandatory Week of Fun Week (MWOFW) while at Riverbed, I entered a 4-person eating relay challenge as a team of one. I came in second place, by a matter of seconds. I have not yet recovered from this humiliating defeat.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Do you have any hidden talents?</span></strong></h2>
<p>I’m a self taught pianist but I can’t read music. I learned “Revolutionary Etude” by listening to 100 different Spotify recordings of it on repeat for about 4 weeks, trying to follow the sheet music while on the train. I spent two weeks imagining what fingers I would use to push those notes on the piano, then was able to play the song on the piano in two days. I don’t do this very often.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">If you could have dinner with any one person (living or dead), who would you choose and why? What would you talk about?</span></strong></h2>
<p>My uncle, who passed not long ago.&nbsp; I did not get the chance to say goodbye.&nbsp; I wouldn’t do any talking - he had all the wisdom in the world and I would’ve listened to him for years.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">If you could time travel, where in time would you go and why?&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">I would probably go at least 60 million years in the future. I’m really curious about what the trees are going to look like.</span></p>

","2025-01-09 11:26:27","<p>Effective market-based compensation should be accessible to companies at every stage of growth. For far too long, HR and comp teams from smaller organizations have had to compete for talent against enterprise-level businesses while carrying the heavy load of inefficient job pricing— spending hours hunting for reliable data, muddling through spreadsheets, or pricing jobs one-by-one. Not to mention, this is on top of the <em>very</em> full plate they already have.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>We’re pleased to fill this gap with the release of <a href=""/prime"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">BetterComp Prime + Market Data</a>. Small and mid-sized businesses can now access defensible data, powered by industry leader Mercer, tailored just for them, plus the technology to make it actionable.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Do I really need data?&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #2f3139;""><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Company%20Bottom%20Line.jpg"" width=""280"" height=""280"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Company Bottom Line"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 280px; float: left; margin: 0px 25px 8px 10px;"">Making decisions around pay without data is like a pilot flying without a navigation system— a disaster waiting to happen. In compensation, the cost of doing nothing (as in having no data) is far too great given that employee salaries impact not only the company’s bottom line but also the company culture and </span><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><a href=""/blog/compensation-can-make-or-break-employer-brand"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">employer brand</a></span><span style=""color: #2f3139;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">.</span> Data is the key that will help you make informed decisions and build a strong foundation for effective compensation.</span><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""></span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">What if I am using crowdsourced data today?&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>If you are a small or mid-sized business using crowdsourced data today, you are not alone. For many companies who feel limited in their options, crowdsourced data has been an appealing choice. It's easily accessible, cost-effective, and better than having no data at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, when it comes to compensation where decisions have high visibility and high price tags, it’s hard to ignore the risks associated with using crowdsourced data alone. Because this data is self-reported, it’s very difficult to eliminate biases and inconsistencies or validate for factuality.</p>
<p>Here are a few <img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Different%20Job%20Descriptions.jpg"" width=""273"" height=""273"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""Different Job Descriptions"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 273px; float: right; margin: 15px 30px 10px 20px;"">examples of when crowdsourced data may fall short:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li aria-level=""1"">Someone may post their total compensation package as their base salary.</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Certain jobs can have very different meanings and responsibilities across companies and industries.&nbsp;</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">There are unknowns around sample size or when the data was reported.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because crowdsourced data is not built on rigorous methodology like traditional compensation surveys, relying solely on crowdsourced information can lead to a distorted understanding of a job’s market value and skewed salary ranges. Overpaying or underpaying your talent rarely has a standalone impact. Instead, it has the potential to cause a domino effect of issues like pay compression, pay inequity, or unsustainable budgets.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">What makes BetterComp Prime + Market Data different?</span></strong></p>
<p>Whether you are a comp team of one or one of a few, you deserve powerful partners that empower you. Now with BetterComp Prime + Market Data, small and mid-sized businesses can access a one-stop solution that pairs trusted market data with the technology to make it actionable.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><strong>The Difference With Prime Market Data</strong></h3>
<p>Prime Market Data is not crowdsourced, aggregate data. Instead, we partnered with Mercer, a leader in the compensation market data space, to bring small and mid-sized businesses a gold-standard data set designed specifically for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At BetterComp, we partner with the best-in-class data providers and this collaboration with Mercer is a prime example of our commitment to excellence for our customers. With <a href=""https://www.mercer.com/about/company/about/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>Mercer</span></a> holding over 75 years of industry experience and confidence from thousands of leading organizations around the world, you can rest easy knowing that the data is…&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Reliable</strong> - accurate, free from biases, and follows a precise and transparent methodology</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Validated</strong> - has undergone extra checks and balances to inspect for any abnormalities and ensure that the data is indeed trustworthy</li>
<li aria-level=""1""><strong>Defensible</strong> - your compensation decisions are grounded in data from a credible source</li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #2f3139;""><img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/BetterComp%20Prime%20Launch%20Feature%20Image.png"" width=""300"" height=""175"" loading=""lazy"" alt=""BetterComp Prime Launch Feature Image"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 300px; float: left; margin: 0px 25px 10px 10px;"">Having data you can count on gives comp pros and HR leaders the solid foundation they need to get compensation right. Using a trusted data source also shows a commitment to data integrity and transparency, which amplifies credibility amongst executives and employees alike. This can empower comp pros to become better advocates and strategic advisors in helping their team achieve organization goals.&nbsp;</span><span style=""font-size: 20px; color: #2f3139;""></span></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><strong>The Difference With Our Technology</strong></h3>
<p>Along with access to a gold-standard data set powered by Mercer, BetterComp Prime brings you next-level compensation technology that enables you to make the most out of this data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gone are the days of combing through hundreds of rows in spreadsheets or using multiple systems to price a job. With BetterComp, you get a one-stop shop for all things market pricing. It’s a single-repository where you can:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level=""1"">Manage, process, and analyze all your survey data</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Price jobs and model ranges</li>
<li aria-level=""1"">Utilize robust, custom reporting and analytics</li>
</ul>
<p>Our user-friendly technology streamlines and automates the manual parts of the market pricing process so you can focus less on repetitive work and more on making a strategic impact.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>This is just a sneak peek of our technology, so be sure to</em> <a href=""/demo-request"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"" style=""font-style: italic;"">connect with our team to see it in action.</a></p>
<h3 style=""font-size: 30px;""><strong>The Difference With Our Support</strong></h3>
<p>I’d be remiss to discuss the BetterComp difference without calling out our unrivaled customer support. Customer experience is at the forefront of all that we do. BetterComp customers get access to dedicated support from knowledgeable comp pros who have walked in your shoes and truly understand your needs.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>Can you share a brief overview of your professional background and how you ended up in your current role?</strong></span></h2>
<p>I graduated from the University of Nevada Business School majoring in Finance and Economics. I began my professional career as a financial analyst with a local defense contractor (SNC) working on labor projections and modeling. This gave me my first taste of compensation related data and all the complexities involved. After a couple years, I jumped at an opportunity to immerse myself in compensation by leaving the finance department and learning on the job as a compensation analyst. Before I knew it I was modeling fringe benefits, bonus plans, and playing with all things compensation data. Then BetterComp posted a position that aligned to all my favorite aspects of comp data but on a larger scale. BetterComp allows me to play with compensation data on a global and almost universal scale, I couldn’t pass it up.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>Describe your role at BetterComp:&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
<p>Today, we bring in data from just over 80 different compensation survey vendors across all BetterComp customers. The format and structure of the data they provide varies widely between them, so my primary focus is creating normalization processes for the consumption of that data. Using integrated python coding, the output of these processes is a uniform data structure feeding into BetterComp, giving our customers a seamless view across all their survey vendors. Boredom is certainly not part of the job! Whether I am problem solving with our DevOps team, brainstorming with our Data Operations team or pulling together market analysis for our executive team, no two days are alike.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">What is your favorite part about your job and working at BetterComp?</span></strong></h2>
<p>The best part about my job is the variability in the intraday. No two days are alike. This is inherent with a start-up environment, but even more evident in compensation. The compensation strategy of different organizations can be as unique as a person's fingerprint, so each approach to refine and normalize the compensation data is like a puzzle. I see it as getting paid to work on puzzles everyday: it's glorious!&nbsp;</p>
<p>My favorite part about working at BetterComp is our embodiment of ""<em>Better</em>"". Sure, we're better than our competitors, but even more importantly we're better today than we were yesterday, last month, last year, etc. From my first day, there has been an emphasis on incrementally getting better and that just aligns with my soul.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><strong>What do you like doing when you’re not at work?</strong></span></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Outside of my exciting days at BetterComp, I moonlight as a wrangler of toddlers (1 and 3 year old) and weekends as a soccer observer (10 year old). My wife is an avid cookie baker and decorator, so I need to constantly be out mountain biking for the sake of my arteries.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">What has been your favorite project or assignment so far? Why was it special to you?</span></strong></h2>
<p>With our year-over-year growth, our data operations team saw more than double the survey results volume from 2022 to 2023. Our emphasis on being incrementally Better everyday led us to not only process the additional volume, but do so with an even faster cycle time than the previous year. I am proud to be a part of a team that focuses on technological solutions to augment our small but mighty team.</p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Fun Fact:</span></strong></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px; font-weight: normal;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><span style=""color: #000000;"">I have owned close to 50 different vehicles. On average, I buy and sell 3 cars per year.</span></span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px; font-weight: normal;""><span style=""color: #6e6f71;""><span style=""color: #000000;""><strong><span style=""color: #6e6f71;"">Favorite Book:</span></strong></span></span></h2>
<p>Jurassic Park. The theory and level of detail in the book got me hooked. This was the first book I read that had my heart racing at the end. Highly recommended even if you’ve watched all the movies.</p>

"How Focus Drives Innovation at BetterComp","How Focus Drives Innovation at BetterComp","https://www.bettercomp.com/blog/focus-drives-innovation-bettercomp","Breaking down BetterComp's product philosophy: Focus on our core competency, innovate like crazy, and bring those innovations to our growing customer base.","2025-01-09 11:23:29","<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">One of my favorite stops in my career was the 3-ish years I spent at Workday. I was employee #764 (and I have the coffee mug to prove it!). While I was there, we went through a successful IPO and grew to over 3,000 employees when I left. I wasn’t a huge part of Workday’s success in any way shape or form, but I took away a series of valuable learnings.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">One key take-away was the importance of focus. At Workday, we called it “<a href=""https://blog.workday.com/en-us/2015/defining-the-power-of-one.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">The Power of One</a>” - all of our resources went into one version of Workday, one version that every customer used, only one set of code to maintain.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Contrast that with our competitors who had grown by acquisition - a customer running Oracle couldn’t talk to a customer running PeopleSoft and really get anywhere. From a product development perspective, any feature built for a PeopleSoft customer did absolutely zero for any Oracle customer and vice versa. Any innovation that was developed would only help some of the customers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Now it seems that legacy comp technology is going down the same path as Oracle - multiple products, with multiple support options, multiple roadmaps, multiple data sets. Customers running one product don’t get any updates to any other product (not that there are many updates anymore).</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Focused and Deep vs. Scattered and Shallow</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">At BetterComp, it’s important that all of our customers benefit from the innovation we’re creating with the <a href=""/solutions"" rel=""noopener"">BetterComp platform</a>. Our product strategy is built on the idea that market pricing has long been too manual and too cumbersome and it’s only through innovation that we can move the industry forward. Splitting innovation across multiple products wouldn’t let us move fast enough to keep up with changing business conditions.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Part of the inspiration for this type of focus stems not just from my time at Workday but also something Jim Collins calls out in his seminal business book, <a href=""https://www.jimcollins.com/article_topics/articles/good-to-great.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Good to Great</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">He calls it the “hedgehog concept” in reference to the fable of the Fox and the Hedgehog. For those of you who are unfamiliar, the nuts and bolts of the story are as follows:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style=""padding-left: 40px;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">A fox sees a hedgehog and decides that said hedgehog would make a delicious snack. The fox tries over and over, with increasingly complex methodology, to eat the hedgehog, but each time the hedgehog curls up in a spikey ball and the fox can’t eat it. The idea is that while the fox knows a lot of things, the hedgehog knows one perfectly.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">In Collins’ book, he equates the hedgehog to successful companies that are built around one clear, easily stated idea. Our take on this is focusing on one product to drive innovation to make market pricing Better.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">In practice, this means several things.</span></p>
<h3><strong>1. Our customers drive the direction of our product.&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">We are committed to listening and working with our users to adapt our product in ways that bring real value to their day-to-day. A lot of comp software is bogged down with “nice to haves” that maybe look flashy but don’t get used or don’t address a core customer need. Conversely, when we roll out new features, our team focuses on making sure customers are aware of all the new features through our white-glove support model and that those updates actually move the needle for the comp teams who rely on our software.</span></p>
<h3><strong>2. Our customers get access to updates and new features as soon as they’re ready.&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">We’re not splitting our customer base and only giving access to people who are on one product. Every BetterComp customer gets access to every feature. Always.</span></p>
<h3><strong>3. We leverage partnerships to bring our customers comprehensive solutions.</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Our expertise is in market pricing, but comp and HR teams need a wide array of solutions to cover things like pay equity, payroll management, benefits, and job description management - not to mention accessing market data. Since we don’t believe in offering our customers mediocrity, we work with carefully vetted partners who are the best at what they do to support these needs. Partners like <a href=""https://jdxpert.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">JDXpert</a> (job descriptions), <a href=""https://synd.io/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Syndio</a> (pay equity), and <a href=""https://www.decusoft.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Decusoft</a> (employee compensation management) all collaborate with the BetterComp team to answer the varied needs of our customers.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">And, when it comes to data, because we are a data-agnostic platform, we work closely with all the premier market survey providers to identify and bring customers the data they need. Our partners include Aon, Mercer, WTW, and Culpepper - and we have relationships with many other survey vendors to support our customers' data needs.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 36px;"">Building a Better Customer Experience</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">As a result of this focus, our customers see more innovation on a faster timeline. For example, we’ve worked with our customers to help drive market pricing at scale and partnered with both customers and survey data providers to support access to survey data in under 24 hours - up to 9 days faster than legacy provider’s SLAs.</p>

From the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic to the Great Resignation, the way we work - and the way companies compensate their employees - has changed significantly. 2023 isn’t likely to see any major upheavals (hopefully), but the growth and continuation of shifts that took root during the past three years should be on the forefront of every comp pro’s mind.</p>
<!--more--><h2 style=""font-size: 28px;"">1. Continued Wage Growth</h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">While there are a few <a href=""https://www.cfodive.com/news/cfos-2023-plan-keep-pay-raises-below-inflation-fed-recession/639370/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">dissenting opinions</a>, recent data from compensation survey providers <a href=""https://www.wtwco.com/en-US/News/2022/11/us-pay-increases-to-hit-4-point-6-percent-in-2023-wtw-survey-finds"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">WTW</a> and <a href=""https://www.imercer.com/articleinsights/Recession-fears-don-t-seem-to-be-impacting-increase-budgets"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mercer</a> indicate an annual salary budget increase of 4.3-4.6% for 2023. That’s up from salary budget increases in 2022, and even over <a href=""https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2022/07/14/2479938/0/en/Tight-labor-market-drives-U-S-employers-to-boost-2023-pay-raises.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">mid-year predictions</a>.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">This is particularly notable amid our current state of economic uncertainty. The tech layoffs we saw over the last half of 2022 and the <a href=""http://bettercomp.com/blog/how-inflation-affects-compensation-what-every-comp-pro-should-know"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">steep inflation</a> of the past couple years paint a picture of a labor market that’s trending conservative. Typically, this would indicate a slow-down in wage growth, but that’s just not the case.</span></p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">Unemployment remains - and is predicted to remain - close to historically low (just 3.7% in November, according to the </span><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><a href=""https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2022/unemployment-rate-3-7-percent-in-november-2022.htm"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a></span><span style=""color: #2f3139;""><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">)</span>. Meanwhile, many industries are still working to fill talent gaps and even companies that are fully staffed are working to manage pay compression precipitated by the high wages new hires were commanding during the Great Resignation. Add in the fact that more than half of professionals feel underpaid, according to a </span><span style=""font-size: 20px;""><a href=""https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-workers-share-salary-expectations-and-priorities-in-todays-job-market-301631597.html"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">recent survey by Robert Half</a></span><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">, and you have a recipe for substantial continued wage growth.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 28px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;"">2. Remote Work is Here to Stay</span></h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><a href=""https://www.fastcompany.com/90827748/3-simmering-workplace-controversies-that-will-boil-over-into-2023""><span>Fast Company</span></a> recently called out the conflict about where work takes place as one of the key things to watch in 2023. Remote work is very much on people’s minds, but the supply of fully remote jobs is insufficient to meet the demand. <a href=""https://www.axios.com/2022/12/04/remote-jobs-linkedin-supply-demand"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>According to Axios</span></a>, there’s a 35-point gap between the number of jobseekers who want a remote role (50%) and percentage of fully remote roles available (15%).&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">That said, remote work is not going anywhere, <img src=""https://21848769.fs1.hubspotusercontent-na1.net/hubfs/21848769/Man-working-from-home-with-dog.jpg"" alt=""Man-working-from-home-with-dog"" width=""200"" height=""239"" loading=""lazy"" style=""height: auto; max-width: 100%; width: 200px; float: right; margin: 3px 0px 3px 10px;"">and will, in fact, continue to grow. A r<a href=""https://www.upwork.com/press/releases/economist-report-future-workforce"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>ecent survey from Upwork</span></a> predicts that 36.2 million Americans will work remotely by 2025, and <a href=""https://www.gallup.com/workplace/397751/returning-office-current-preferred-future-state-remote-work.aspx"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank""><span>research by Gallup</span></a> determined that fully remote work arrangements will triple relative to those available in 2019. In addition, Gallup found that 77% of remote-capable employees expected to work remotely all or part of the time going forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;""><span style=""color: #2f3139;""><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">I’ve written before about the <a href=""/blog/compensation-conundrum-navigating-pay-for-remote-teams"" rel=""noopener"">impact of remote work on comp teams</a>. </span><span style=""color: #2f3139;"">Fully or partially distributed workforces make for compensation challenges, but they’re not insurmountable. 2023 will see executive leadership and compensation teams developing a clearer, well-documented playbook for managing compensation in distributed teams.</span></span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 28px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;"">3. Need for Better and More Timely Market Data</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">With wages increasing and remote work becoming the new norm, comp professionals will be asked to provide better market analysis. And t<span style=""color: #2f3139;"">he way to do t</span>hat is by maximizing the use of your or expanding your market data. That could mean going deeper by leveraging more specific cuts, better aligning your job architecture with survey data, or adding surveys for a more complete market view.</span></p>

<h2 style=""font-size: 28px;""><span style=""color: #405caa;"">4. Importance of Pay Transparency</span></h2>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">Lots of people thought of 2022 as the year of <a href=""https://www.bettercomp.com/blog/effective-market-pricing-important-pay-transparency"">pay transparency</a>, but I anticipate we’ll see the trend really <a href=""https://www.natlawreview.com/article/looking-ahead-to-2023-pay-transparency-developments"">come into its own in 2023</a>. For starters, key legislation requiring upfront pay ranges for posted positions became effective in California and Washington as of January 1st. And, most recently, <a href=""https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-signs-legislation-establishing-statewide-pay-transparency-law"">New York state</a> passed legislation that will go into effect September 17, 2023 (NYC already had a pay transparency requirement in place). As of writing this, other states including Massachusetts and South Carolina have similar legislation pending, and many other jurisdictions have pay transparency legislation that stops somewhat short of requiring upfront salary range disclosure. (View a full list of applicable laws from <a href=""https://www.hrdive.com/news/pay-transparency-law-tracker-states-that-require-employers-to-post-pay-range-or-wage-range/622542/"">HR Dive</a>.)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 20px;"">In 2023, we’ll hit the real inflection point in pay transparency. A plurality, if not a majority, of the workforce live and work in jurisdictions that have or will soon have pay transparency statutes in place. And the success of these measures are likely to drive further changes to support pay equity. This means that comp teams, recruiters, and hiring managers will need to work together to develop a strategy to address job postings and salary ranges - and soon.</span></p>
<h2 style=""font-size: 28px;"">Managing Comp in 2023 and Beyond</h2>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Comp pros have a lot to contend with in the coming year. To succeed, they need to maximize efficiency while providing more in-depth, nuanced information in support of business goals and talent strategy.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Technology for comp teams, including modern market pricing solutions can help bridge the gap between necessary outputs and the hands available to do the work. Our customers find that BetterComp’s ability to facilitate market pricing at scale enables their team to manage market pricing in a fraction of the time relative to legacy software tools (or, heaven forbid, spreadsheets).</p>
